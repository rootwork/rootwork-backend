# Rootwork.org

Rootwork is created with the static site generator [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for the build process. Rootwork's backend is a fork of [Victor Hugo](https://github.com/netlify/victor-hugo) from the Nov. 7, 2017 commit.

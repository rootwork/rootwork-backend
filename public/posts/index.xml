      <description>Devsigner is celebrating the cross-overs, the multi-disciplinarians, the coders who paint and the designers who send pull requests &amp;mdash; and those who want to develop some new left-right brain skills.
We&amp;rsquo;re looking for folks to break out of their familiar meetup silos and apply their knowledge across the crafts of development and design.
Join me at Devsigner in Portland, Oregon, May 23-25!
Tickets are now on sale, and session submissions are open until this Friday, May 2!</description>

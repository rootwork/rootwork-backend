SMACSS, or Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS, was developed by Jonathan Snook, a featured speaker at Drupalcon Portland. I'm really excited to get the opportunity to have Jonathan speak, not only because of my personally well-dog-eared copy of SMACSS, but because Drupal itself is adopting a SMACSS approach to its CSS.</description></item><item><title>Drupalcon Portland: Responsive web design in a snap with Breakpoint and Sass</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupalcon-portland-responsive-web-design-snap-breakpoint-sass/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupalcon-portland-responsive-web-design-snap-breakpoint-sass/</guid><description>
Media queries are a key part of responsive web design, because they control at what width (among other things) different CSS rules kick in. “Breakpoint makes writing media queries in Sass super simple,” say Mason Wendell and Sam Richard, creators of the extension to Compass, and they’re right. It’s not surprising that we’d want them to present at Drupalcon, since design in Drupal, like web design everywhere, has been embracing responsive web design as a fundamental principle.</description></item><item><title>Drupal 8 and the power of Twig: A Drupalcon Portland featured session</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-power-twig-drupalcon-portland-featured-session/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-power-twig-drupalcon-portland-featured-session/</guid><description>
A new theming engine, Twig, is coming along with Drupal 8’s adoption of the Symfony framework.

“By necessity, base themes make assumptions about how teams and individuals work. By rolling your own, you’ll become much more comfortable and informed about the Drupal theming layer, and have a better launchpad for your front-end projects.”</description></item><item><title>Ninjas in your code at Drupalcon Portland: Sass with extends and placeholders</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-with-extends-placeholders/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-with-extends-placeholders/</guid><description>

The big news at Drupalcon Portland is that, for the first time at a Drupalcon, we’re having separate frontend and user experience (UX) tracks. That means we were able to offer even more sessions targeted directly at frontend developers, and as the local track chair for frontend, I’m really excited about what we’ve ended up with!</description></item></channel></rss>

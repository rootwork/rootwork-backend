      <description>For the Genocide Intervention Network, involvement in the &amp;ldquo;social web&amp;rdquo; is really an outgrowth of our entire mission: To form the first anti-genocide constituency, and to empower our members with the tools to prevent and stop genocide. The words &amp;ldquo;constituency&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;empower&amp;rdquo; are key. We want an educated, active movement of people interested in preventing and stopping genocide. Our members need to be able to think for themselves on the issue, not to simply be another name on a list, but to be a hub in an ever-expanding network.</description>

      <description>Just wanted to highlight a small initiative the Genocide Intervention Network sent out today using Collactive, a web firm that helps organizations use their network of members to promote news stories and websites to larger audiences. In this case, we are asking our members to vote up an article on our anti-genocide hotline, 1-800-GENOCIDE.</description>

      <description>Although these two panels &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Leveraging the Power of Participatory Media&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Future of Online Outreach&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; were held separately at the 2007 Nonprofit Technology Conference, I thought that they related so well that I&amp;rsquo;d present them together.</description>

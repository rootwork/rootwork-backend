For the Genocide Intervention Network, involvement in the "social web" is really an outgrowth of our entire mission: To form the first anti-genocide constituency, and to empower our members with the tools to prevent and stop genocide. The words "constituency" and "empower" are key. We want an educated, active movement of people interested in preventing and stopping genocide. Our members need to be able to think for themselves on the issue, not to simply be another name on a list, but to be a hub in an ever-expanding network.</description></item><item><title>Notes from NTC: Participatory media and the future of online outreach</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2007/04/notes-ntc-participatory-media-future-online-outreach/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Apr 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2007/04/notes-ntc-participatory-media-future-online-outreach/</guid><description>

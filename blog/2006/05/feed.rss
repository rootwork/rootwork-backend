      <description>Keep these different types of elites in mind as we think about the intersections of technology and social change. One way of achieving change is by appealing to the state&amp;rsquo;s powerholders &amp;ndash; traditional power, that is.

As a result of our origins as a student group, we have a strong history in using online social networking and viral campaigns.</description>

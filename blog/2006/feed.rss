      <description>Offering concrete ideas for how to solve a seemingly insurmountable problem can give people a sense that they, as individuals, have a stake in an issue. This sort of advocacy is similar to bottom-up, open-source collaborative projects like Wikipedia, in which no one group has proprietary ownership over an idea or a product; instead, the goal is a constant generation of awareness and ideas. Social media can be &amp;ldquo;a tool for mobilizing people for different kinds of action.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Keep these different types of elites in mind as we think about the intersections of technology and social change. One way of achieving change is by appealing to the state&amp;rsquo;s powerholders &amp;ndash; traditional power, that is. But throughout history, coalitions of people without this power have banded together to effect change. It may be that among the three other types of elites, a social movement can emerge that represents true democratic change.</description>

      <description>The Genocide Intervention Network is a nonprofit based in DC that is a little more than two years old. We began as a student group at Swarthmore College with an idea: to change the way the world responds to genocide. As a result of our origins as a student group, we have a strong history in using online social networking and viral campaigns.</description>

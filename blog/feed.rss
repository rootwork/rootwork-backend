      <description>SMACSS, or Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS, was developed by Jonathan Snook, a featured speaker at Drupalcon Portland. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to get the opportunity to have Jonathan speak, not only because of my personally well-dog-eared copy of SMACSS, but because Drupal itself is adopting a SMACSS approach to its CSS.</description>

      <title>Drupalcon Portland: Responsive web design in a snap with Breakpoint and Sass</title>

      <description>Media queries are a key part of responsive web design, because they control at what width (among other things) different CSS rules kick in. &amp;ldquo;Breakpoint makes writing media queries in Sass super simple,&amp;rdquo; say Mason Wendell and Sam Richard, creators of the extension to Compass, and they&amp;rsquo;re right. It&amp;rsquo;s not surprising that we&amp;rsquo;d want them to present at Drupalcon, since design in Drupal, like web design everywhere, has been embracing responsive web design as a fundamental principle.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;By necessity, base themes make assumptions about how teams and
individuals work. By rolling your own, you&amp;rsquo;ll become much more comfortable
and
informed about the Drupal theming layer, and have a better launchpad for
your

      <description>The big news at Drupalcon Portland is that, for the first time at a Drupalcon, we&amp;rsquo;re having separate frontend and user experience (UX) tracks. That means we were able to offer even more sessions targeted directly at frontend developers, and as the local track chair for frontend, I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about what we&amp;rsquo;ve ended up with!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder Dan Pallotta is so popular among the TED crowd &amp;ndash; business leaders and wealthy technologists who can see a product in every social trend. What&amp;rsquo;s more mystifying is why he would be popular among nonprofits, activists, and social changemakers, because it&amp;rsquo;s clear he has no substantive message for them.</description>

      <description>Domain Registry of America sends the owner of a website domain an official-looking &amp;ldquo;expiration notice,&amp;rdquo; urging the owner to &amp;ldquo;act today&amp;rdquo; to prevent &amp;ldquo;loss of your online identity making it difficult for your customers and friends to locate you.&amp;rdquo; Yet Domain Registry of America vastly overcharges for domain registration &amp;ndash; their entire business model is built on swindling people into switching their registration. Don&amp;rsquo;t let it happen to you!</description>

      <description>Organizations concerned about the privacy of their visitors should carefully weigh whether a given social widget is worth the risk in privacy. Moreover, these organizations should absolutely provide a privacy policy that specifically lays out what&amp;rsquo;s being collected and by whom, and may also want to consider suggesting ways for those at risk to circumvent this data tracking.</description>

      <description>While this presentation does not cover the basics of what Google Plus is and how it works, it looks at how nonprofits and activists might effectively use Google Plus and highlights its most useful tools. The presentation also discusses the effects that Google Plus&amp;rsquo;s approach to social networking might have on online activism in general.</description>

Along with the grant, the poetry will be turned into a song by Bill Dillon; there are also secondary prizes for $5,000, $1,000, and guitars autographed by members of Los Lonely Boys. The deadline is March 28.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s great that Google is directing money to nonprofits, and letting people decide where those donations go. But it&amp;rsquo;s frustrating how Chrome for a Cause is rooted in a scarcity model &amp;ndash; in which organizations must compete rather than collaborate.</description>

      <description>Now all visitors to a nonprofit&amp;rsquo;s Facebook Page will be directed to the Wall. What&amp;rsquo;s more, with tabs being de-emphasized by their move to smaller links under your profile, it&amp;rsquo;s less obvious how new visitors can find out more about your organization.</description>

      <description>Sexism is bigger than any one person; it&amp;rsquo;s a system in which our entire society is enmeshed. Too often, such systematic discrimination as treated as discrete, individual acts, disconnected from the larger reality. What too many men miss is the reality that the system under which they face such inhumane expectations is the same one that limits the potential of women. This exists in the technology and nonprofit tech communities no less than the rest of society &amp;ndash; and has to be faced in a systematic way, not simply by counting the number of women on a tech panel.</description>

      <description>Online activism didn&amp;rsquo;t come out of nowhere. The methods and tactics of online activists &amp;ndash; be they individuals or international nonprofits with hundreds of staff &amp;ndash; are drawn on social change movements and community organizing strategies that have been tried, experimented with, failed, tweaked, and tried again, long before the Internet existed.</description>

      <description>Last week, Special Envoy to Sudan Gen. Scott Gration sat down with representatives from Save Darfur and the student network STAND for an unprecedented live Q&amp;amp;A, webcast directly from the White House website. The webcast was notable not just for its interactivity &amp;ndash; members of both STAND and Save Darfur were encouraged to submit questions, which were then asked directly of Gration on air &amp;ndash; but for its accountability.</description>

      <description>To Causes, leaving MySpace to focus on its core community on Facebook made good business sense, but certainly those organizations left in the lurch on MySpace feel otherwise. Simply put, you can&amp;rsquo;t rely on third-party, often for-profit services to support your organization&amp;rsquo;s interests. What would it look like if nonprofits and social change movements &amp;ndash; which these third party applications often use to market themselves as effective and &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; started demanding some openness?</description>

      <description>Social media doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you do less organizing &amp;ndash; it means you (can) do it better, or at least differently. You still have to use all the old skills of coalition-building, strategic planning, creative social action, managing relationships and preventing burnout. None of that goes away just because you&amp;rsquo;re engaging with people on Facebook instead of in town halls.</description>

      <description>If organizers limit themselves to seeing Twitter as a strategy in and of itself &amp;ndash; without considering the strategy apart from the tool &amp;ndash; they risk overlooking ways to run a more effective campaign on other platforms, or augmenting a campaign using multiple platforms. Worse, organizers risk giving supporters feel-good activism that quenches their desire for social change without actually moving the movement closer to a concrete goal, or putting any pressure on powerholders.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note to say I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking as part of Social Actions&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Using Facebook for Social Change&amp;rdquo; webinar on Thursday, along with Susan Gordon, the nonprofit coordinator of Causes, and moderated by Beth Pickard and David Karp of Firstgiving: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re invited to join in a live and open text chat to discuss how you can use Facebook for social change. This is your opportunity to share experiences and ask questions about how people and orgs can do outreach, inspire action, and fund raise on the Facebook network.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>In this presentation from the Democracy in Action Community Conference 2008, I talk about some of the successful approaches for nonprofits in using social networks like Facebook and MySpace, and social media like Flickr and YouTube. I give detailed examples of how the Genocide Intervention Network, where I served as director of communications and Internet strategy coordinator for four years, used social networking to achieve its goals in membership development, advocacy and fundraising.</description>

      <description>Some nonprofits, older and more institutionalized, are wary of giving their members &amp;ldquo;control&amp;rdquo; of their &amp;ldquo;message&amp;rdquo; in social media. Mostly, I think that&amp;rsquo;s nothing more than a fear of losing power. When you think you know how to change the world, it can be hard for some people to want to involve others. But the message to nonprofits seems pretty clear: Stand in our way, and we&amp;rsquo;ll just go around you.</description>

      <title>Drupal for nonprofits, or, how to build social networks for change</title>

      <title>Organizing rather than mobilizing: Using social networks for constituency-building</title>

      <description>For the Genocide Intervention Network, involvement in the &amp;ldquo;social web&amp;rdquo; is really an outgrowth of our entire mission: To form the first anti-genocide constituency, and to empower our members with the tools to prevent and stop genocide. The words &amp;ldquo;constituency&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;empower&amp;rdquo; are key. We want an educated, active movement of people interested in preventing and stopping genocide. Our members need to be able to think for themselves on the issue, not to simply be another name on a list, but to be a hub in an ever-expanding network.</description>

      <description>Just wanted to highlight a small initiative the Genocide Intervention Network sent out today using Collactive, a web firm that helps organizations use their network of members to promote news stories and websites to larger audiences. In this case, we are asking our members to vote up an article on our anti-genocide hotline, 1-800-GENOCIDE.</description>

      <description>Although these two panels &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Leveraging the Power of Participatory Media&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Future of Online Outreach&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; were held separately at the 2007 Nonprofit Technology Conference, I thought that they related so well that I&amp;rsquo;d present them together.</description>

      <title>The theory of bottom-up social networking</title>
      <link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2006/12/theory-bottom-up-social-networking/</link>

      <description>Offering concrete ideas for how to solve a seemingly insurmountable problem can give people a sense that they, as individuals, have a stake in an issue. This sort of advocacy is similar to bottom-up, open-source collaborative projects like Wikipedia, in which no one group has proprietary ownership over an idea or a product; instead, the goal is a constant generation of awareness and ideas. Social media can be &amp;ldquo;a tool for mobilizing people for different kinds of action.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <title>Different kinds of elites (and different kinds of elitism)</title>

      <description>Keep these different types of elites in mind as we think about the intersections of technology and social change. One way of achieving change is by appealing to the state&amp;rsquo;s powerholders &amp;ndash; traditional power, that is. But throughout history, coalitions of people without this power have banded together to effect change. It may be that among the three other types of elites, a social movement can emerge that represents true democratic change.</description>

      <description>The Genocide Intervention Network is a nonprofit based in DC that is a little more than two years old. We began as a student group at Swarthmore College with an idea: to change the way the world responds to genocide. As a result of our origins as a student group, we have a strong history in using online social networking and viral campaigns.</description>

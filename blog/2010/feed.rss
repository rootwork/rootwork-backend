      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s great that Google is directing money to nonprofits, and letting people decide where those donations go. But it&amp;rsquo;s frustrating how Chrome for a Cause is rooted in a scarcity model &amp;ndash; in which organizations must compete rather than collaborate.</description>

      <description>Now all visitors to a nonprofit&amp;rsquo;s Facebook Page will be directed to the Wall. What&amp;rsquo;s more, with tabs being de-emphasized by their move to smaller links under your profile, it&amp;rsquo;s less obvious how new visitors can find out more about your organization.</description>

      <description>Sexism is bigger than any one person; it&amp;rsquo;s a system in which our entire society is enmeshed. Too often, such systematic discrimination as treated as discrete, individual acts, disconnected from the larger reality. What too many men miss is the reality that the system under which they face such inhumane expectations is the same one that limits the potential of women. This exists in the technology and nonprofit tech communities no less than the rest of society &amp;ndash; and has to be faced in a systematic way, not simply by counting the number of women on a tech panel.</description>

      <description>Online activism didn&amp;rsquo;t come out of nowhere. The methods and tactics of online activists &amp;ndash; be they individuals or international nonprofits with hundreds of staff &amp;ndash; are drawn on social change movements and community organizing strategies that have been tried, experimented with, failed, tweaked, and tried again, long before the Internet existed.</description>

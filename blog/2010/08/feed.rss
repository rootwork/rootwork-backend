      <description>Sexism is bigger than any one person; it&amp;rsquo;s a system in which our entire society is enmeshed. Too often, such systematic discrimination as treated as discrete, individual acts, disconnected from the larger reality. What too many men miss is the reality that the system under which they face such inhumane expectations is the same one that limits the potential of women. This exists in the technology and nonprofit tech communities no less than the rest of society &amp;ndash; and has to be faced in a systematic way, not simply by counting the number of women on a tech panel.</description>

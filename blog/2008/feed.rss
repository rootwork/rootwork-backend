      <description>In this presentation from the Democracy in Action Community Conference 2008, I talk about some of the successful approaches for nonprofits in using social networks like Facebook and MySpace, and social media like Flickr and YouTube. I give detailed examples of how the Genocide Intervention Network, where I served as director of communications and Internet strategy coordinator for four years, used social networking to achieve its goals in membership development, advocacy and fundraising.</description>

      <description>Some nonprofits, older and more institutionalized, are wary of giving their members &amp;ldquo;control&amp;rdquo; of their &amp;ldquo;message&amp;rdquo; in social media. Mostly, I think that&amp;rsquo;s nothing more than a fear of losing power. When you think you know how to change the world, it can be hard for some people to want to involve others. But the message to nonprofits seems pretty clear: Stand in our way, and we&amp;rsquo;ll just go around you.</description>

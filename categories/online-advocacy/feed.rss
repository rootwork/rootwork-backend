      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder Dan Pallotta is so popular among the TED crowd &amp;ndash; business leaders and wealthy technologists who can see a product in every social trend. What&amp;rsquo;s more mystifying is why he would be popular among nonprofits, activists, and social changemakers, because it&amp;rsquo;s clear he has no substantive message for them.</description>

      <description>Online activism didn&amp;rsquo;t come out of nowhere. The methods and tactics of online activists &amp;ndash; be they individuals or international nonprofits with hundreds of staff &amp;ndash; are drawn on social change movements and community organizing strategies that have been tried, experimented with, failed, tweaked, and tried again, long before the Internet existed.</description>

      <description>Last week, Special Envoy to Sudan Gen. Scott Gration sat down with representatives from Save Darfur and the student network STAND for an unprecedented live Q&amp;amp;A, webcast directly from the White House website. The webcast was notable not just for its interactivity &amp;ndash; members of both STAND and Save Darfur were encouraged to submit questions, which were then asked directly of Gration on air &amp;ndash; but for its accountability.</description>

      <title>Organizing rather than mobilizing: Using social networks for constituency-building</title>
      <link>https://rootwork.org/blog/2007/10/organizing-rather-mobilizing-using-social-networks-constituency-building/</link>

      <description>For the Genocide Intervention Network, involvement in the &amp;ldquo;social web&amp;rdquo; is really an outgrowth of our entire mission: To form the first anti-genocide constituency, and to empower our members with the tools to prevent and stop genocide. The words &amp;ldquo;constituency&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;empower&amp;rdquo; are key. We want an educated, active movement of people interested in preventing and stopping genocide. Our members need to be able to think for themselves on the issue, not to simply be another name on a list, but to be a hub in an ever-expanding network.</description>

      <description>Just wanted to highlight a small initiative the Genocide Intervention Network sent out today using Collactive, a web firm that helps organizations use their network of members to promote news stories and websites to larger audiences. In this case, we are asking our members to vote up an article on our anti-genocide hotline, 1-800-GENOCIDE.</description>

      <title>Notes from NTC: Participatory media and the future of online outreach</title>
      <link>https://rootwork.org/blog/2007/04/notes-ntc-participatory-media-future-online-outreach/</link>

      <description>Although these two panels &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Leveraging the Power of Participatory Media&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Future of Online Outreach&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; were held separately at the 2007 Nonprofit Technology Conference, I thought that they related so well that I&amp;rsquo;d present them together.</description>

      <title>The theory of bottom-up social networking</title>
      <link>https://rootwork.org/blog/2006/12/theory-bottom-up-social-networking/</link>

      <guid>https://rootwork.org/blog/2006/12/theory-bottom-up-social-networking/</guid>
      <description>Offering concrete ideas for how to solve a seemingly insurmountable problem can give people a sense that they, as individuals, have a stake in an issue. This sort of advocacy is similar to bottom-up, open-source collaborative projects like Wikipedia, in which no one group has proprietary ownership over an idea or a product; instead, the goal is a constant generation of awareness and ideas. Social media can be &amp;ldquo;a tool for mobilizing people for different kinds of action.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <title>Different kinds of elites (and different kinds of elitism)</title>
      <link>https://rootwork.org/blog/2006/05/different-kinds-elites-different-kinds-elitism/</link>

      <description>Keep these different types of elites in mind as we think about the intersections of technology and social change. One way of achieving change is by appealing to the state&amp;rsquo;s powerholders &amp;ndash; traditional power, that is. But throughout history, coalitions of people without this power have banded together to effect change. It may be that among the three other types of elites, a social movement can emerge that represents true democratic change.</description>

      <title>Can blogging stop genocide?</title>
      <link>https://rootwork.org/blog/2006/05/can-blogging-stop-genocide/</link>

      <description>The Genocide Intervention Network is a nonprofit based in DC that is a little more than two years old. We began as a student group at Swarthmore College with an idea: to change the way the world responds to genocide. As a result of our origins as a student group, we have a strong history in using online social networking and viral campaigns.</description>

Organizations concerned about the privacy of their visitors should carefully weigh whether a given social widget is worth the risk in privacy. Moreover, these organizations should absolutely provide a privacy policy that specifically lays out what’s being collected and by whom, and may also want to consider suggesting ways for those at risk to circumvent this data tracking.</description></item><item><title>Facebook removes default landing tab for new nonprofit pages</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2010/12/facebook-removes-default-landing-tab-new-nonprofit-pages/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2010/12/facebook-removes-default-landing-tab-new-nonprofit-pages/</guid><description>

To Causes, leaving MySpace to focus on its core community on Facebook made good business sense, but certainly those organizations left in the lurch on MySpace feel otherwise. Simply put, you can’t rely on third-party, often for-profit services to support your organization’s interests.

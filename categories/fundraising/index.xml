The Community TechKnowledge Foundation announced today a grant of $10,000 for a nonprofit that submits a description of their mission -- in the form of a poem. Along with the grant, the poetry will be turned into a song by Bill Dillon; there are also secondary prizes for $5,000, $1,000, and guitars autographed by members of Los Lonely Boys. The deadline is March 28.</description></item><item><title>Google Chrome for a cause, or, nonprofit deathmatch strikes again</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2010/12/google-chrome-cause-nonprofit-deathmatch-strikes-again/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2010/12/google-chrome-cause-nonprofit-deathmatch-strikes-again/</guid><description>

To Causes, leaving MySpace to focus on its core community on Facebook made good business sense, but certainly those organizations left in the lurch on MySpace feel otherwise. Simply put, you can’t rely on third-party, often for-profit services to support your organization’s interests. What would it look like if nonprofits and social change movements -- which these third party applications often use to market themselves as effective and "good" -- started demanding some openness?</description></item></channel></rss>

The Community TechKnowledge Foundation announced today a grant of $10,000 for a nonprofit that submits a description of their mission -- in the form of a poem. Along with the grant, the poetry will be turned into a song by Bill Dillon; there are also secondary prizes for $5,000, $1,000, and guitars autographed by members of Los Lonely Boys. The deadline is March 28.</description></item><item><title>Google Chrome for a cause, or, nonprofit deathmatch strikes again</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2010/12/google-chrome-cause-nonprofit-deathmatch-strikes-again/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2010/12/google-chrome-cause-nonprofit-deathmatch-strikes-again/</guid><description>

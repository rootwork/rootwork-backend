Gandhi led India to freedom. Or Rosa Parks, who one day was too tired to get up and inspired a city to boycott a racist public policy.\n       The second story we tell is about a spontaneous event. Something shifted in the world around us, and people responded in positive ways. Egyptians took to the square to reclaim their democracy.\n       While both of these stories have kernels of truth ‚Äî events happen, and people inspire ‚Äî they are fundamentally not how social change occurs. Instead, it‚Äôs movement-building work that pushes change forward.\n       Rosa Parks wasn‚Äôt just tired ‚Äî she was trained.\n       The Egyptian revolution didn‚Äôt just happen, it was preceded by years of student organizing.\n       The most successful social change movements didn‚Äôt just get lucky or figure out how to use the newest tools, they were built through concerted strategic planning. Our work for change can draw on that history and experience.\n       Catalyst moments might be unplanned, but the infrastructure can be built.\n       In our organizations, we tend to privilege one set of actions over the other. We focus on important task-based work like website development, fundraising, communications, and the campaign strategy I just mentioned.\n       But there‚Äôs more to an organization and more to a movement than that. There‚Äôs another group of endeavors sometimes called maintenance work, and it flies under the radar even though it‚Äôs crucial to keeping our campaigns afloat.\n       Maintenance work involves things like leadership development, facilitating communication, conflict resolution, anti-oppression work, and visioning, the things that fertilize our movements.\n       We often privilege task work over maintenance work. Community knowledge and strategic knowledge is devalued in favor of technical knowledge, because technical knowledge can be more easily measured.\n       Meanwhile, movement-building work is disproportionately done by women, leaving men in the ‚Äúimportant‚Äù and visible roles.\n       At its worst, a specialization of knowledge leads to accumulation of informal, unacknowledged power through gatekeeping.\n       Or to put it another way, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll launch that campaign when I‚Äôm ready to update the website for you.‚Äù\n       In our organizations, we should be striving toward social change, not startup culture. We should cultivate sustainable work. We should commit to anti-oppression work so we don‚Äôt replicate the unequal society we‚Äôre trying to improve. We should provide benefits rather than relying on a precarious workforce of independent contractors. We should pay our interns. We should allow staff to unionize, or become a worker-owned collective.\n       And in general, we should remember that social change is not a business. We should be ruthless in stealing ideas from the business community, but we should not expect them to work for us just because they made people some money.\n       In closing, my one piece of advice is in addition to all the Twitter guides and fundraising how-tos in your tool belt, explore some movement history. Whether it‚Äôs Poor People‚Äôs Movements about work against economic injustice, I‚Äôve Got the Light of Freedom or Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights about the black-led freedom struggle\n       Or maybe my little article in this recent publication by Green Memes. Investigate how sustainable social change has transpired in the past, and you‚Äôll be closer to effecting change in the future.\n","link":"/blog/2014/03/online-advocacy-learn-community-organizing/","section":"blog","tags":["Drupal"],"title":"What online advocacy can learn from community organizing"},{"body":"","link":"/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"}]

You can view the Slideshare or download the PDF, but the slides are simply images.\nIn many ways this is a retelling of an article I wrote back in 2010 about online and offline organizing, with a more visual focus. If you prefer words to images, the original might serve you better.\nOnline advocacy and community organizingMy background is in community organizing and social movement theory, and that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;d like to talk a little bit about today.\nIn popular culture, we have two stories we usually tell about social change \u0026ndash; two lenses in which we view advocacy and activism.\nThe first is about a charismatic leader. Gandhi led India to freedom. Or Rosa Parks, who one day was too tired to get up and inspired a city to boycott a racist public policy.\nThe second story we tell is about a spontaneous event. Something shifted in the world around us, and people responded in positive ways. Egyptians took to the square to reclaim their democracy.\nWhile both of these stories have kernels of truth \u0026ndash; events happen, and people inspire \u0026ndash; they are fundamentally not how social change occurs. Instead, it\u0026rsquo;s movement-building work that pushes change forward.\nRosa Parks wasn\u0026rsquo;t just tired \u0026ndash; she was trained.\nThe Egyptian revolution didn\u0026rsquo;t just happen, it was preceded by years of student organizing.\nThe most successful social change movements didn\u0026rsquo;t just get lucky or figure out how to use the newest tools, they were built through concerted strategic planning. Our work for change can draw on that history and experience.\nCatalyst moments might be unplanned, but the infrastructure can be built.\nIn our organizations, we tend to privilege one set of actions over the other. We focus on important task-based work like website development, fundraising, communications, and the campaign strategy I just mentioned.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s more to an organization and more to a movement than that. There\u0026rsquo;s another group of endeavors sometimes called maintenance work, and it flies under the radar even though it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to keeping our campaigns afloat.\nMaintenance work involves things like leadership development, facilitating communication, conflict resolution, anti-oppression work, and visioning, the things that fertilize our movements.\nWe often privilege task work over maintenance work. Community knowledge and strategic knowledge is devalued in favor of technical knowledge, because technical knowledge can be more easily measured.\nMeanwhile, movement-building work is disproportionately done by women, leaving men in the \u0026ldquo;important\u0026rdquo; and visible roles.\nAt its worst, a specialization of knowledge leads to accumulation of informal, unacknowledged power through gatekeeping.\nOr to put it another way, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll launch that campaign when I\u0026rsquo;m ready to update the website for you.\u0026rdquo;\nIn our organizations, we should be striving toward social change, not startup culture. We should cultivate sustainable work. We should commit to anti-oppression work so we don\u0026rsquo;t replicate the unequal society we\u0026rsquo;re trying to improve. We should provide benefits rather than relying on a precarious workforce of independent contractors. We should pay our interns. We should allow staff to unionize, or become a worker-owned collective.\nAnd in general, we should remember that social change is not a business. We should be ruthless in stealing ideas from the business community, but we should not expect them to work for us just because they made people some money.\nIn closing, my one piece of advice is in addition to all the Twitter guides and fundraising how-tos in your tool belt, explore some movement history. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s Poor People\u0026rsquo;s Movements about work against economic injustice, I\u0026rsquo;ve Got the Light of Freedom or Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights about the black-led freedom struggle\nOr maybe my little article in this recent publication by Green Memes.

How has it changed your own\nworkflow?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMW: Before Sass 3.2 came out I had written an article for The Sass Way that\npreviewed some of it\u0026rsquo;s new features, including the ability to use variables in\nmedia queries. I created an example that baked in some names for breakpoints\ninto a kind of \u0026ldquo;master mixin\u0026rdquo; for media queries. On my next responsive project I\nput the theories I\u0026rsquo;d written for that post into practice, and found that I could\nrefine that approach. If I assigned a variable to each media query first the\napproach would be very flexible. Then when noticed that I wrote min-width\nqueries way more often than any other type I set up defaults that made creating\nmedia queries very fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMW: There was a side effect that I think is more useful though. By assigning\nnames to each of my media queries I\u0026rsquo;m able to keep them in context in a much\nmore effective way. If I some media queries to deal with the width of a nav\nelement, and then later I add an item to that nav, I can change the value of\nthat variable and all the associated queries are adjusted. This is even more\neffective when handing code back and forth within a team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSR: Breakpoint was created with the motivation to ease many of the pain points\nof working with media queries in CSS. The biggest pain point that Breakpoint\nsolves is providing meaningful semantics to your media queries. When building\ncontent based responsive sites, early in your design process two unrelated items\nmay happen to break at the same points, but as your project grows, those points\nmay change and a simple find and replace will have unintended consequences. This\nis probably the biggest workflow win to using Breakpoint, all of your media\nqueries now have proper semantics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSR: The other big win for my workflow is Breakpoint\u0026rsquo;s\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/at-import/breakpoint/wiki/No-Query-Fallbacks\"\u003eno-query fallback\u003c/a\u003e,\nallowing me to very easily add in fallback code for any of the media queries I\nwrite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIB: What can Breakpoint do that just assigning variable names to specific\nmin-widths can\u0026rsquo;t?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSR: For starters, Breakpoint handles much more than min-width queries. It is\ndesigned to be future friendly and currently supports all CSS level 3 and level\n4 media queries. Additionally, it\u0026rsquo;s syntax is easy to use to create complex\nmedia queries, including both and and or media queries. It has native handling\nfor all of the different media query requirement for resolution (of which you\nneed to write at least four different queries for currently) while just writing\nthe standard. The no-query fallbacks are a huge win as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMW: The main benefit is that you can assign names and manage your media queries\nwith variables.

Breakpoint,\nlike Sass, was built to be backend independent. This means that if you are\nbuilding any site, regardless of if it\u0026rsquo;s a Drupal site or a Node site or a\nstatic site, Breakpoint is able to do its job handily without being caught up in\nbeing tied to a specific backend technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMW: One of the things I love about working with Sass is that it\u0026rsquo;s not\nDrupal-specific, and it\u0026rsquo;s meant to be used anywhere on the web.

Respond-To was written before Breakpoint, but upon\nBreakpoint\u0026rsquo;s release, it was decided that our efforts should be focused on a\nunified Media Query engine, with Respond-To as a wrapper syntax for Breakpoint.\nThis is how the current Respond-To project exists. As of Breakpoint 2.0, the\nRespond-To mixin has been incorporated into Breakpoint core, so you now can use\nRespond-To without needing an additional Compass extension!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIB: Do you use\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/breakpoints\"\u003eBreakpoints module\u003c/a\u003e (in Drupal 8\ncore)?

There are no standard breakpoints, period, and good, reasonably\ncomplex responsive sites will usually have 20 or more breakpoints. Responsive\ncannot be done from the backend, and the Breakpoint module encourages you to do\nso (as does the\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/spark\"\u003eSpark layout initiative\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIB: Do you think any aspects of Breakpoint might get rolled directly into Sass\nin the future?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMW: It\u0026rsquo;s possible, but we probably won\u0026rsquo;t move the obvious parts to the Sass\nlanguage. There are some helper functions that we\u0026rsquo;ve written in Ruby that would\nbe very useful in Sass core. Once that\u0026rsquo;s in we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to offer Breakpoint\nwithout Compass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSR: I do not believe Breakpoint will be rolled directly into Sass, nor would I\nwant it to be, as it is out of scope of Sass core. As much as I like them, I\neven think the color functions in Sass are out of scope for it. Sass core should\nsimply be the language and the bare minimum function base for it to be useable.\nSass doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with any mixins, and I think it should probably stay that way.\nThat being said, Breakpoint is fairly stable; our 1.3 release stood stable for\nsix or so months without needing any changes until we rewrote the whole thing\nfor our 2.x release, so maybe being merged into Compass isn\u0026rsquo;t out of the\nquestion, but I do not see a need for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIB: I hear in addition to Breakpoint, Sam went and created some kind of magic\nbox of Sass called \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/at-import/toolkit\"\u003eToolkit\u003c/a\u003e.

I\u0026rsquo;d say the four\nbiggest thing that Toolkit has are a modern Clearfix mixin, progressive\nenhancement replace text mixins, a triangle generation mixin, and an intrinsic\nratio mixin to make using intrinsic ratios super easy.

We tend to talk about accessibility like we talk about\ngender. Both have coded values. When we speak of being gendered, we are often\ntalking about being non-male. Male is a kind of genderless base state. So is it\nwith accessibility. When we speak of making something accessible, we tend to\nrefer to making an interface for blind users or for users with physical\ncapabilities that make keyboard and mouse use difficult, as examples. Visual is\na kind of accessible base state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe risk \u0026ldquo;othering\u0026rdquo; folks for whom accessibility is an issue because as\ndevelopers, in general, non-visual accessibility has not been a primary concern.\nI know what is is like to be othered. In some ways, highlighting otherness can\nbe an effective way to bring focus to a problem. Eventually though, we need to\nresolve those issues and close the loop on the otherness. We can be other and\nalso be equal. Now is the time for front end developers to start thinking about\naccessibility as a multi-modal effort. We no longer have the excuse that the\ntools and technologies available to us do not support efficient workflows for\nnon-visual UI development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIB: Where is Drupal 8 going to do better?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJRB: Most importantly, we have more individual core contributors this cycle who\ntruly believe in addressing accessibility issues. And they are all smart,\nwonderful people which makes working with them a pleasure!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, take\n\u003ca href=\"https://drupal.org/node/1811128\"\u003ethis issue about requirement warnings during installation\u003c/a\u003e.\nFor a sighted user, a warning during installation is immediately apparent. The\nmissing requirement is made distinct with color contrast. For a blind user, they\nmust traverse every cell in the table to discover a missing requirement. Would\nwe ever impose such a burden on a sight user through the UI? No, not without\ngrumbles in the issue queues at least. With more contributors invested in\nimproving these types of non-visual details, we are polishing all the rough\nedges \u0026ndash; the ones we see \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e the ones we don\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIB: How important is context in aural interfaces?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJRB: Context is important to all interfaces. As front end developers we build\ntemplates that expose context in a predictable, consumable way. As a practice we\nhave established and then refined patterns of visual expression over the past\n30-plus years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMetaphors grounded visual pointer displays on a virtual desktop. We talk of\nvisual affordances in rounded, gradient-embellished, reflective buttons.\n\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph\"\u003eSkeumorphic designs\u003c/a\u003e bring our\nunderstanding of the physical world to bear on pixels and bits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere are the metaphors in aural interface design?

The metal is bare underneath them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps non-visual interfaces have one less level of abstraction to traverse.\nMaybe there\u0026rsquo;s no need to translate language into symbol and then back into\nlanguage.

So much\nthat we humans do starts with structure that softens with time to fit our curvy,\nwinding nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to believe that the aural interfaces we have today still just the awkward\nfirst attempts to build an abstract audio interface pattern language.

Renée about Drupal 8 and the nature of working on accessibility, the passion for this work really shown through. I\u0026rsquo;m really looking forward to their session with Wim, \u0026ldquo;Drupal Speaks: Aural user interfaces, new Drupal 8 accessibility features,\u0026rdquo; on Wednesday at 10:45 AM. Hope to see you there!\nIB: What are we missing when we talk about accessibility right now?\nJRB: I want developers to understand that accessibility is fundamental to user interface development. We tend to talk about accessibility like we talk about gender. Both have coded values. When we speak of being gendered, we are often talking about being non-male. Male is a kind of genderless base state. So is it with accessibility. When we speak of making something accessible, we tend to refer to making an interface for blind users or for users with physical capabilities that make keyboard and mouse use difficult, as examples. Visual is a kind of accessible base state.\nWe risk \u0026ldquo;othering\u0026rdquo; folks for whom accessibility is an issue because as developers, in general, non-visual accessibility has not been a primary concern. I know what is is like to be othered. In some ways, highlighting otherness can be an effective way to bring focus to a problem. Eventually though, we need to resolve those issues and close the loop on the otherness. We can be other and also be equal. Now is the time for front end developers to start thinking about accessibility as a multi-modal effort. We no longer have the excuse that the tools and technologies available to us do not support efficient workflows for non-visual UI development.\nIB: Where is Drupal 8 going to do better?\nJRB: Most importantly, we have more individual core contributors this cycle who truly believe in addressing accessibility issues. And they are all smart, wonderful people which makes working with them a pleasure!\nFor example, take this issue about requirement warnings during installation. For a sighted user, a warning during installation is immediately apparent. The missing requirement is made distinct with color contrast. For a blind user, they must traverse every cell in the table to discover a missing requirement. Would we ever impose such a burden on a sight user through the UI? No, not without grumbles in the issue queues at least. With more contributors invested in improving these types of non-visual details, we are polishing all the rough edges \u0026ndash; the ones we see and the ones we don\u0026rsquo;t.\nIB: How important is context in aural interfaces?\nJRB: Context is important to all interfaces. As front end developers we build templates that expose context in a predictable, consumable way. As a practice we have established and then refined patterns of visual expression over the past 30-plus years.\nMetaphors grounded visual pointer displays on a virtual desktop. We talk of visual affordances in rounded, gradient-embellished, reflective buttons. Skeumorphic designs bring our understanding of the physical world to bear on pixels and bits.\nWhere are the metaphors in aural interface design? I know of none. To me, these interfaces are flat. The metal is bare underneath them.\nPerhaps non-visual interfaces have one less level of abstraction to traverse. Maybe there\u0026rsquo;s no need to translate language into symbol and then back into language. But that little bit of designer in me, that memory of a linguist I almost was, remembers being thunderstruck with insight reading Jackendoff\u0026rsquo;s unfurling of metaphor after I had just so recently fallen smitten with the strict generative grammar of early Chomsky. Jackendoff gives us a way of understanding language that starts at basic physical dichotomies \u0026ndash; up/down and near/far \u0026ndash; and from there offers us a model of communication. He gives us pattern. (Early) Chomsky gave us metal. So much that we humans do starts with structure that softens with time to fit our curvy, winding nature.\nI want to believe that the aural interfaces we have today still just the awkward first attempts to build an abstract audio interface pattern language. That non-visual interface design is still working through its structuralist phase. We are still learning how to pack context into denser forms through non-visual expressions.\nIB: Will the Drupal 8 improvements have things to offer module developers?\nJRB: In Drupal 8, we are building tools that manage a couple of the trickier components of accessibility in a browser. These are:\nOutputting audio updates Managing tabbing in constrained workflows Module developers will be able to pass a string to a method called \u0026ldquo;announce\u0026rdquo; on the Drupal object and have that string read by a screen reader.\nAnother method on the Drupal object called \u0026ldquo;tabbingManager\u0026rdquo; will constrain tabbable elements on the page. A developer will select those elements, either through JavaScript methods or jQuery, and pass them to the tabbingManager. Tabbing is then constrained to those elements until the constraint is superseded or released. I know that must not be completely clear, but that\u0026rsquo;s why we\u0026rsquo;re presenting a session about aural user interfaces and how we can use these new tools to build them!\n"},"name":"Drupal 8, aural interfaces and groundbreaking accessibility at Drupalcon Portland","photo":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-aural-interfaces-groundbreaking-accessibility-drupalcon-portland/switchboard-publicdomain.jpg","published":"2013-05-16T00:00:00Z","summary":"Drupal is getting a switchboard operator!

That\u0026rsquo;s a sentiment I\u0026rsquo;ve heard others express when they started using it \u0026ndash; and I was pretty late to the party.\nI got attracted to it initially through variables. We\u0026rsquo;ve all been there when a client or a designer wants to change a color and suddenly we have to change dozens or hundreds of values across CSS.\nDale Sande captures that kind of revolution in efficiency that Sass brings, as seen in a screenshot from his upcoming presentation at Drupalcon Portland.\nBut Dale, who\u0026rsquo;s spoken plenty on Sass and organizes the Seattle Sass meetup, is taking us way past the Sass basics like variables, and that\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see his presentation next week.\nAround the same time Sass came onto the scene, some thoughtful people were exploring more maintainable frontend development and CSS architecture through ideas/acronyms like OOCSS, SMACSS and BEM, and folks like Nicole Sullivan, Jonathan Snook (a Drupalcon featured speaker!), Nicolas Gallagher, and Harry Roberts.\nI spoke with Dale about Sass, object-oriented CSS and some the things he\u0026rsquo;ll be covering at Drupalcon. Be sure to join me at his session, \u0026ldquo;Sass: OO\u0026rsquo;S\u0026rsquo;CSS w/Extends and Silent Placeholders,\u0026rdquo; on Wednesday at 2:15 PM!\nIB: Some people argue SASS creates bloated code \u0026ndash; do you see placeholders addressing that concern effectively?\nDS: Sass doesn\u0026rsquo;t create bad code. Bad coders do.\nThe whole concept of placeholder selectors was designed to fight code bloat and be a more pragmatic solution to OOCSS. In my presentation, I illustrate how using the various techniques generate code.\nThe real \u0026ldquo;ah-ha\u0026rdquo; moment comes when we see how using placeholder selectors makes it easier to manage and literally re-use code \u0026ndash; thus reducing dreaded CSS bloat.\nIB: What\u0026rsquo;s the advantage to using silent placeholders over mixins for a set of rules?\nDS: Simply put, being able to re-use code without duplicating code. The use of mixins was the first part of being DRY with our code. Looking at the Sass it felt AWESOME! But when we looked at the output CSS, this is when we realized that we were all living a lie.\nOur CSS rules were being duplicated tens, if not hundreds of times. We weren\u0026rsquo;t being DRY, we simply put the onus of duplication on the machine.\nPlaceholder selectors embrace the one of the oldest concepts of CSS and that is to extend the CSS selector for reuse. But with traditional CSS this was difficult to do, especially when you were dealing with thousands of lines of code. Sass\u0026rsquo; @extend directive allows developers to create name-spaced reusable chunks of code that is portable, re-usable and extendable without duplicating anything.\nIB: Do you see placeholders as helping to reduce the amount of tight coupling \u0026ndash; scattering pieces of styles in multiple places?\nDS: While placeholder selectors are a tool that can help with scattered code, it is not the only solution. Having a file/folder structure that embraces the different types of code, e.g. CSS selectors, placeholder selectors, mixins and functions, can assist in creating reusable modulare code and maintain a process of control over the many parts.\n"},"name":"Ninjas in your code at Drupalcon Portland: Sass with extends and placeholders","photo":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-extends-placeholders/qDG7XKJLKbs_unsplash-lazycreekimages.jpg","published":"2013-05-14T00:00:00Z","summary":"Dale Sande captures the revolution in efficiency that Sass brings, and at Drupalcon Portland he\u0026#39;s taking us way past Sass basics.\n","type":"entry","updated":"","url":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-extends-placeholders/"},{"author":{"name":"Ivan Boothe","photo":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/images/ivan_256.jpg","type":"card","url":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/"},"category":"frontend development, Drupal, Planet Drupal, frontend","content":{"html":"\u003cp\u003eThe big news at Drupalcon Portland is that, for the first time at a Drupalcon,\nwe\u0026rsquo;re having separate\n\u003ca href=\"https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/tracks/#frontend\"\u003efrontend\u003c/a\u003e and\n\u003ca href=\"https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/tracks/#UX\"\u003euser experience (UX)\u003c/a\u003e\ntracks.

If only charities were run more like businesses, he says \u0026ndash; with high executive pay and less belief in large \u0026ldquo;overhead\u0026rdquo; being a stand-in for inefficiency \u0026ndash; they\u0026rsquo;d be able to do more.\nDan follows in the long tradition of successful businessmen (it\u0026rsquo;s almost always men) arriving on the nonprofit scene talking loudly and listening rarely.\nHis ideas are wrong almost by design, because Dan isn\u0026rsquo;t interested in making nonprofits more powerful; he\u0026rsquo;s interested in making society more receptive to unrestrained business \u0026ndash; nonprofits, in this case, are merely a proxy.\n\u0026ldquo;He is not a credible defender of nonprofits because he doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to really care for them.

How insulting to think that, if we make less pay than our for profit counterparts, we must be less creative, talented, intelligent and less capable of helping others.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ndash; Ken Berger, Charity Navigator\nThe entire approach is based on the scarcity-model, zero-sum game that people like to play with charities. In the past I\u0026rsquo;ve referred to this as nonprofit deathmatch.\nYet lots of research has shown people who donate once are more likely to donate again, even to other organizations in the same field \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s why some nonprofits sell their lists. And the same principle is at work with advocacy: get people interested and they\u0026rsquo;ll keep taking action.\nGetting away from the scarcity model allows organizations to build movements instead of just lists.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not suprising that his views are so limited when he consistently groups all organizations into \u0026ldquo;nonprofits\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;charities\u0026rdquo; without recognizing the huge differences among them.\nService organizations have very different goals from advocacy-based organizations, to say nothing of institutional nonprofits like universities, hospitals and museums.

You can download a PDF of the slides or view the presentation on Slideshare.\n(Google insists on referring to its system as \u0026ldquo;Google+\u0026rdquo; but that wreaks havoc on search engines, so throughout this post I\u0026rsquo;ll be referring to it as \u0026ldquo;Google Plus\u0026rdquo; instead.)\nDesigned for personal profiles At the moment, Google Plus is only designed to have profiles for people, similar to core Facebook profiles. Business profiles, like Facebook Pages, are likely coming in the future. In the meantime you could try to circumvent this by creating a \u0026ldquo;person\u0026rdquo; with the name of an organization, but just like with Facebook, that risks having your profile deleted. (More on that in a moment.)\nOne positive aspect of this is that it gets easier to organize among people you know. Until now, social networks have basically had two models: Public profiles that don\u0026rsquo;t require real names, like MySpace and Twitter, and private profiles that do require real names, like Facebook.\nWith Google Plus, profiles are both public and under people\u0026rsquo;s real names, meaning that if you have a list of donors, supporters or volunteers you could conceivably find each one who has a Google Plus profile relatively easily. (LinkedIn has a similar setup, but is largely used for job-seeking and, unlike Google Plus, requires an account in order to see profiles \u0026ndash; so at best they are only semi-public.)\nProfessionalizing communicationsIf you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with The Cathedral \u0026amp; the Bazaar you\u0026rsquo;ll recognize the concepts of formal and informal communication. Unlike communication among friends, Google Plus is designed to formalize communications.\nIn the same way you might segment or target an email to a particular list of supporters\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;you can make the same sort of targeted post through Google Plus:\n(Community) organizingWhile this is helpful for one-to-one communications, it means organizing in a group or collective voice \u0026ndash; common in spaces like Facebook Groups, Twitter hashtags, and blogging circles \u0026ndash; is more difficult.\nOrganic groups simply don\u0026rsquo;t have a mode to interact or connect, with the minor exception of in a post\u0026rsquo;s comments. That said, if you know who your \u0026ldquo;network connectors\u0026rdquo; are, you might have success at creating viral messages. Google Plus is oriented around a \u0026ldquo;multi-hub small world\u0026rdquo; concept. (Here\u0026rsquo;s a PDF of Valdis Krebs and June Holley discussing and illustrating these concepts.)\nOn requiring real namesGoogle Plus, like Facebook before it, has taken the position that all profiles must be linked to a single actual human person. No pseudonyms, no fictional characters, no group identities, no profiles of pets or inanimate objects, no creative or destructive bots. For some online organizers, in contrast to the chaos of Twitter or MySpace this might seem like a welcome shift.\nIndeed, Google CEO Eric Schmidt said last year,\nOne of the errors that the Internet made a long time ago is that there was not an accurate and non-revocable identity-management service. \u0026hellip; And the best example of an identity-management service today that\u0026rsquo;s reasonably reliable is Facebook.\u0026quot;\nHowever it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember what gets left behind when we require real names in a social network.\nFirst: It\u0026rsquo;s dangerous for some people. Survivors of domestic violence, political activists in many societies around the world, marginalized folks such as LGBT people, and anyone who has reason to be anonymous online will simply not be able to participate. Researcher danah boyd has gone so far as to call Google Plus\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;nymwars\u0026rdquo; policy \u0026ldquo;an abuse of power\u0026rdquo;:\nThe people who most heavily rely on pseudonyms in online spaces are those who are most marginalized by systems of power. \u0026ldquo;Real names\u0026rdquo; policies aren\u0026rsquo;t empowering; they\u0026rsquo;re an authoritarian assertion of power over vulnerable people.\nThe Geek Feminism Wiki has an extensive entry on who is harmed by \u0026ldquo;real names\u0026rdquo; policies.\nSecond is the loss of creativity \u0026ndash; and creative activism \u0026ndash; when we demand that people tie their writings to a legal identity. (Boyd points out that somehow Facebook\u0026rsquo;s strict policy on real names has never required Lady Gaga to identify as Stefani Germanotta.)\nIn the context of social movements, we sometimes remember organizers through real names (Martin Luther King, Jr.; Mohandas Gandhi) but often we know them through names other than what might have been their legal identity: Malcolm X, Mother Jones, Sylvia Rivera, or Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Ross and known throughout her work as \u0026ldquo;Moses\u0026rdquo;).\nActivists often use \u0026ldquo;movement names\u0026rdquo; of one type or another, like the Chinese pro-democracy activist Michael Anti, recently deleted under Facebook\u0026rsquo;s policy. Jillian C. York points out at the EFF that successful online organizing is often done under a kind of group pseudonym, as with the Egyptian uprising originating in posts on the \u0026ldquo;We Are All Khaled Said\u0026rdquo; Facebook page. And of course the use of \u0026ldquo;handles\u0026rdquo; online is older than the Web itself \u0026ndash; arguably older than the Internet, if you consider communication tools like ham radio.\nSome of us would argue that far from being an \u0026ldquo;error\u0026rdquo; as Google\u0026rsquo;s Schmidt would have it, online use of pseudonymous, anonymous, temporary, artistic, or otherwise \u0026ldquo;unofficial\u0026rdquo; identities has been a core reason for the Internet\u0026rsquo;s growth and strength. So if this does represent a broader shift toward identity-focused social networks, activists will need to adapt and, in some cases, circumvent these policies.\nUpdate, Oct. 5, 2015: The EFF has launched an initiative called The Nameless Coalition, calling on all social networks to step back from \u0026ldquo;real name\u0026rdquo; policies.\nGoogle Plus HangoutsIn addition to Google Plus profiles, Google has launched a new video-chatting system called Google+ Hangouts. This could be useful to online organizers both for quick collaboration with colleagues and for impromptu webinars with supporters. Although there are participation limits, for small groups this offers a welcome no-cost alternative to platforms like WebEx or GoToMeeting.\nConclusionWhenever I talk about online organizing, I emphasize that it\u0026rsquo;s important to go where your people are.\nThere are aspects of every social network I like and don\u0026rsquo;t like, as an organizer and as a participant. It\u0026rsquo;s absolutely true that online social networks are seeking to monetize our friendships, volunteer us to generate content for their platforms, and sell the data they collect on us \u0026ndash; the oft-repeated truism that \u0026ldquo;if you\u0026rsquo;re not paying for the product, you are the product.\u0026rdquo; But as an organizer, I go on Facebook the same way that in earlier eras organizers might have gone to churches or pubs: Not because those are places they\u0026rsquo;d personally hang out but because that\u0026rsquo;s where the people are.\nSo don\u0026rsquo;t be swayed by \u0026ldquo;shiny object syndrome\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; if your supporters, fellow activists, or sympathetic communities aren\u0026rsquo;t showing up on Google Plus, there\u0026rsquo;s no reason for you to prioritize it.

I think he\u0026rsquo;s right.\nMen aren\u0026rsquo;t to blame for the lack of representation by women in technology. Nor, clearly, are women to blame. What causes this disparity? One word: Sexism.\n\u0026ldquo;But wait!\u0026rdquo; you cry. \u0026ldquo;Surely there must be someone carrying out this sexism.\u0026rdquo; And indeed, that\u0026rsquo;s true \u0026ndash; many individual men, and some women, often put forth ideas or enact policies that are rooted in sexism.\nBut sexism is bigger than any one person; it\u0026rsquo;s a system in which our entire society \u0026ndash; certainly the privileged, Western technology community \u0026ndash; is enmeshed.\nToo often, such systematic discrimination as treated as discrete, individual acts, disconnected from the larger reality. And so Arrington can complain:\nEvery damn time we have a conference we fret over how we can find women to fill speaking slots.\nBy attempting to fill a quota, he thinks he can inoculate himself (or his conference) against the charge of sexism. (He then makes the absurd point that, really, women are getting annoyed by being asked to speak at conferences all the time \u0026ndash; which tends to undo that inoculation a small bit.)\nMen are privileged most directly by sexism, of course, which is why Arrington\u0026rsquo;s post is so galling. He suggests \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo; need women \u0026ldquo;who go out and start companies\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;complain about how there are too few women in tech,\u0026rdquo; as if justice in the technology community and the larger society is only the job of those who are marginalized, and never the ones who hold power.\nPart of this is due to the retreat from full-fledged feminism into what Tim Wise has called \u0026ldquo;the diversity trap,\u0026rdquo; in which a commitment only to \u0026ldquo;different backgrounds\u0026rdquo; motivates any kind of diversity. He\u0026rsquo;s writing about racism and affirmative action, but the movement is the same \u0026ndash; away from working to end sexism or racism, and toward an anodyne pledge to provide different perspectives. Wise quotes then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan, upon signing affirmative action into law in 1974:\nTime and experience have shown that laws and edicts of non-discrimination are not enough. Justice demands that each and every citizen consciously adopt and accentuate a commitment to affirmative action, which will make equal opportunity a reality.\nProviding opportunity alone won\u0026rsquo;t work when the playing field is already tilted. Simply inviting speakers from a field from which women have been systematically filtered since birth is too late in the game.\nArrington makes the mind-boggling assertion that women are at an advantage, because there are so few of them that the press wants to write about the ones who \u0026ldquo;make it.\u0026rdquo; This is the \u0026ldquo;talented tenth\u0026rdquo; turned on its head \u0026ndash; that because a few individuals have struggled against overwhelming odds toward success, and that the media naturally wants to cover such extraordinary stories, the institutional oppression that existed to make those stories exceptional in the first place somehow disappears. As the death threats against tech writer Kathy Sierra demonstrated, straight-up sexism still holds sway among large parts of this male-domainted field.\nIn the sub-field of nonprofit technology, many if not most of the people I look to are women: Beth Kanter, Amy Sample Ward, Michelle Murrain, Alexandra Samuel, Marnie Webb, Allyson Kapin, Deborah Elizabeth Finn, Allison Fine, Debra Askanase, Katrin Verclas, Britt Bravo, Laura Quinn, Mary Joyce, Holly Ross, Jocelyn Harmon, Carie Lewis, Rebecca Leaman, Danielle Brigida, Christine Egger, Heather Mansfield, Shireen Mitchell, Nancy Schwartz, Ruby Sinreich, Susan Tenby, danah boyd, Nancy Scola, Kivi Leroux Miller, Judith Freeman, Jordan Dossett, Roz Lemieux, Wendy Harman, Eve Simon, Alnisa Allgood, Jean Russell, Susan Gordon, Katya Andresen, Maddie Grant, Margaux O\u0026rsquo;Malley \u0026ndash; and that\u0026rsquo;s just off the top of my head (sorry if I missed anyone).\nYet even in this space, women leaders are repeatedly judged on their appearance. In the nonprofit field as a whole, despite there being more women than men in leadership, they\u0026rsquo;re still paid less across the board, although the gap is slowly shrinking. In part this may explain the success of women in this field, as any kind of social work is seen as women\u0026rsquo;s work.\nArrington is feeling put-upon because he\u0026rsquo;s experiencing women who point out the inequity in representation and leadership as a personal attack on him. It\u0026rsquo;s not that unusual of a response \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s the same experience white folks have when people of color talk about racism, straight people have when queers demand equal treatment, and able-bodied individuals have when persons with disabilities expect equal access.\nThis is how oppression is set up \u0026ndash; forcing individuals to compete against one another as individuals and rendering its pervasive influence invisible.\nMichael Arrington is right to be outraged. But the outrage should be focused on the sexism that keeps both men and women down.\nWhile it\u0026rsquo;s women who bear the overwhelming amount of oppression from sexism, it\u0026rsquo;s a force that inhibits men\u0026rsquo;s growth as well. Men are expected to take on unbelievable obstacles, toil without complaint and settle for stunted emotional connections to family and friends.\nMany successful men, when confronted with evidence of institutionalized sexism, feel that their accomplishments are being degraded, because they had to struggle mightily under such harsh conditions.\nWhat too many men miss is the reality that the system under which they face such inhumane expectations is the same one that limits the potential of women.\nOf course, there are individual men and women who help to support such a system. Their actions are rightly be identified and they should be given the support and resources to help to change these actions. But changing individual actions isn\u0026rsquo;t enough by itself \u0026ndash; the system must be confronted as a whole.\nThe BlogHer, Women Who Tech, She\u0026rsquo;s Geeky and WebGrrls conferences are one component, as a place for women to strategize and support one another; continually pressing for more visibility for women at tech conferences dominated by men who are simply unaware of women techies is another component.\nWhat would be even more exciting? A conference of male-identified folks interested in supporting women who take on positions of leadership in the tech community.

The methods and tactics of online activists \u0026ndash; be they individuals or international nonprofits with hundreds of staff \u0026ndash; are drawn on social change movements and community organizing strategies that have been tried, experimented with, failed, tweaked, and tried again, long before the Internet existed.\nYet there\u0026rsquo;s often a disconnect between what\u0026rsquo;s seen as online activism \u0026ndash; referred to as \u0026ldquo;slacktivism,\u0026rdquo; sometimes accurately but oftentimes sloppily \u0026ndash; and community-based social change. And that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m covering today at the 2010 Nonprofit Technology Conference, along with Debra Askanase and Amy Sample Ward, in a session called Bringing Community Organizing Into Online Campaigns.\nWhat I mean by community organizingThe idea of community organizing has always been weighted with both political implications and social context, and so one person\u0026rsquo;s interpretation of what \u0026ldquo;counts\u0026rdquo; as community organizing \u0026ndash; and what its implications are \u0026ndash; will vary from the next.\nFor my purposes here, I\u0026rsquo;m using community organizing as the idea that individuals have more power to create change by coming together than by acting alone. Community organizing empowers these individuals, creates long-term change and challenges the structure of power.\nPreviously I\u0026rsquo;ve argued that with the rise of \u0026ldquo;web 2.0,\u0026rdquo; everybody is learning how to be a community organizer. The principles of how to mobilize friends and neighbors around a particular issue \u0026ndash; whether it\u0026rsquo;s a social cause or a hot party \u0026ndash; are being learned every time someone creates a Facebook event.\nSo I think it\u0026rsquo;s reasonable to look at how traditional, on-the-street community organizing can inform purposeful online activism. Once we move beyond the \u0026ldquo;blast all your friends with a link to a petition\u0026rdquo; phase, there are concrete strategies to which we can turn. And many of those strategies are drawn directly from a century or more of social mobilization.\nPrinciples of community organizingThere are five primary ideas in which traditional community organizing is rooted: movement-building, strategy, community accountability, going where the people are, and cultivating leadership. There are more principles and strategies to be sure (and you may disagree whether these five are at the top), but I see these as having the most to say to online activism.\nOrganizing for a movementCommunity organizing is based on long-term strategy. \u0026ldquo;Empowerment\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; that is, facilitating the realization among individuals and communities that they have the power to effect change \u0026ndash; is not something you expect to occur overnight.\nHow this relates to online activism: Every action should be pointing people toward a greater goal. It\u0026rsquo;s straightfoward enough to get people out to a single event, or taking a single online action. But cultivating those individuals so they see their action as part of a long-term campaign is something that takes\u0026hellip;\nStrategy, strategy, strategyI\u0026rsquo;ve written before about the fact that social media isn\u0026rsquo;t about doing less organizing, it\u0026rsquo;s about doing it better. A theory of social change is critical to an individual or organization engaging in online activism. Will signing this petition against the war put pressure on elected leaders to alter policies? Will this upcoming rally (or \u0026ldquo;virtual march\u0026rdquo;) demonstrate a community\u0026rsquo;s growing power \u0026ndash; or is it \u0026ldquo;busy work\u0026rdquo; for supporters who haven\u0026rsquo;t been asked to do anything in a while?\nHow this relates to online activism: Too many nonprofits, unfortunately, seem to engage in token actions that don\u0026rsquo;t move things forward as part of an overall strategy. And even when a given action is a part of a strategy, nonprofits are often vague about communicating that to supporters. Exactly how will calling this legislator advance a critical piece of legislation? Is there a chance the bill will actually pass? If not, there could be other legitimate strategy to build public support for it \u0026ndash; things are long-term, remember? \u0026ndash; but organizations must be clear to supporters that \u0026ldquo;victory\u0026rdquo; in this case won\u0026rsquo;t be a new law, but, for instance, 10 vocal new supporters in Congress.\nBeing accountable to a real-world communityCommunity organizers are often derided as rabble-rousers, troublemakers, or professional activists who dupe people into following them. But true community organizing isn\u0026rsquo;t about swooping in and ginning up outrage by telling the locals to fight the man. It\u0026rsquo;s generally approached as much more Freirian \u0026ndash; taking direction from and being accountable to the local community. Organizers bring their experience of tactics and strategy, and may serve to inspire people that they do have the power to make change. But the causes around which communities organize should come from the community itself.\nHow this relates to online activism: Technology is too often seen as a strategy in and of itself. But the Internet and social media \u0026ndash; like fax machines, phone trees and the printing press before them \u0026ndash; are simply tools, able to be used tactically to great effect, but only when part of a larger strategy. Focusing on the tech divorces a campaign from its community, and leaves the online organizer in the role of the \u0026ldquo;expert\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to use Twitter to clean up your city!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; leaving little room for a community to actually control the direction of a campaign.\nRemembering that the community\u0026rsquo;s long-term strategy is paramount \u0026ndash; and being willing to listen, discern and collaborate with that community \u0026ndash; will help keep the people whose lives and livelihoods are on the line actually in charge.\nGo where the people areSocial change happens in communal spaces \u0026ndash; not always public, but nearly always intimate to the community as it exists. Workers\u0026rsquo; homes and pubs in the labor movement, black churches in the US civil rights movement, gay bars in the gay rights movement, and college campuses in numerous student movements attest to this fact.\nHow this relates to online activism: Rarely will it be effective to create a private \u0026ldquo;walled garden\u0026rdquo; social network that you have to convince people to join and become active on. Different communities are on different social networks online \u0026ndash; and it\u0026rsquo;s important to know where your constituencies are \u0026ndash; on Facebook, MySpace, Twitter or somewhere else. The places where a community is most active socially are most likely to be the places where it\u0026rsquo;s most effective to organize. If you\u0026rsquo;re organizing in a sensitive environment, you may have to establish some level of privacy around your campaign, but only after you\u0026rsquo;ve already engaged people where they are.\nCultivating sustainable leadershipThis is an area to which traditional community organizing aspires, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t always succeed. The temptation for a \u0026ldquo;charismatic leader\u0026rdquo; to emerge and indefinitely control the direction of a social change campaign can be strong. Participants may initially be relieved that they don\u0026rsquo;t have to \u0026ldquo;take the heat\u0026rdquo; when things get tough, and can look to their leader for direction.\nYet time and again we\u0026rsquo;ve seen movements collapse when the leader \u0026ndash; having captured power within the movement or had it thrust upon him or her \u0026ndash; burns out or becomes unable to continue. Increasingly in the past half-century, social movements have attempted to make their approaches more sustainable by cultivating leadership, bringing people from the margins into the center and mentoring and encouraging emerging leaders.\nHow this relates to online activism: Seek to put yourself out of a job. The best online campaigns are the ones that are self-sustaining. Encourage those who are taking the most action to begin to brainstorm new ideas and actions for the campaign. Reward people who are doing the most recruiting, and make them feel that they\u0026rsquo;re a part of the \u0026ldquo;core\u0026rdquo; of the organizing.\nFor nonprofits \u0026ndash; and I know this will be hard to hear \u0026ndash; stop pretending that you\u0026rsquo;re the only organization active on the issue.

Goldbeck, responding to Gration\u0026rsquo;s statement that \u0026ldquo;we know we are going to be held accountable by you,\u0026rdquo; tweeted \u0026ldquo;Yes you will,\u0026rdquo; a message widely reposted by others.\nEmily Diamond-Falk, a spokesperson for the Save Darfur Coalition, was more amiable about the exchange with the White House. \u0026ldquo;As much transparency as they can give us, they will do, without compromising their policy,\u0026rdquo; she told me. \u0026ldquo;He wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to disclose as much information as we asked, which is going to happen in these sorts of things. \u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s a very delicate line, so engaging policy behind the scenes will still be necessary.\u0026rdquo;\nMaking the online Q\u0026amp;A possibleAndrea Clarke, director of communications for the Save Darfur Coalition, pitched the idea of a \u0026ldquo;live online town hall\u0026rdquo; to Gration\u0026rsquo;s communications director in August. \u0026ldquo;We thought it would be something beneficial for activists to be directly engaged around the [Sudan] policy,\u0026rdquo; Clarke said.\nAfter suggesting the idea of an online town hall to Gration, the special envoy suggested the student organization STAND be a part of the conversation as well. \u0026ldquo;The special envoy\u0026rsquo;s office was very committed to answering as many questions as possible, and the involvement of STAND was key to that process,\u0026rdquo; Clarke said. \u0026ldquo;It made for a greater diversity of questions, and we feel the activist community was very well represented.\u0026rdquo;\nGration\u0026rsquo;s travel itinerary made scheduling difficult, and in the end it occurred without much advance notice. Clarke said Save Darfur received at least 500 questions from activists for the special envoy, and \u0026ldquo;I think if we have more lead time we\u0026rsquo;ll have even more questions.\u0026rdquo;\nAs Micah Sifry wrote on Monday, the willingness of the State Department and White House to engage openly and publicly with advocates who are often critical seems unprecedented. Given the negative response to Gration\u0026rsquo;s responses, might this kind of transparency be short-lived?\nClarke said she had \u0026ldquo;no reason to believe there won\u0026rsquo;t be\u0026rdquo; similar events in the future as part of the \u0026ldquo;Ask U.S.\u0026rdquo; program. Gration \u0026ldquo;appears to be working very hard to get feedback,\u0026rdquo; she said. Gration himself wrote that the State Department is \u0026ldquo;eager to continue an active and robust dialogue with the advocacy community.\u0026rdquo;\nLayla Amjadi of STAND lamented the lack of specificity in Gration\u0026rsquo;s answers, telling the Voice of America that activists \u0026ldquo;were really frustrated by how vague the policy review was on benchmarks and pressures and incentives.\u0026rdquo; She called for an approach involving bigger players than Gration alone \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;Obama, Biden and Clinton\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; and declared:\nNow that we know that we\u0026rsquo;ve got their ear, let\u0026rsquo;s talk to them. They\u0026rsquo;re looking for us to hold them accountable. So let\u0026rsquo;s do it.\n\u0026ldquo;There are certainly questions that activists who are voices for those who cannot necessarily be heard right now have, and it\u0026rsquo;s important that those questions are answered by the administration,\u0026rdquo; said Diamond-Falk. \u0026ldquo;The fact that [Gration] engaged the Save Darfur Coalition and the student movement \u0026hellip; proves that activists have to have a voice on this issue and in this administration.\u0026rdquo;\nThe future of high-level advocacy?\u0026ldquo;We certainly hope that this can be one tactic that other advocacy groups can use to demand accountability of the administration,\u0026rdquo; Clarke said. \u0026ldquo;I hope this is something that\u0026rsquo;s taken on board by communications departments of other advocacy groups.\u0026rdquo;\nMost organizations may not have the political pressure necessary to convince public officials to host a live, online questioning. The broad constituency that has been active around Darfur and Southern Sudan for the past five years was a definite advantage to making the webcast happen, Clarke said, as was President Obama\u0026rsquo;s stated support on the campaign trail for resolving the crises in Sudan.\nGration\u0026rsquo;s willingness to engage activists on the issue, however, may have been the most critical element \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s hard to imagine a live Q\u0026amp;A happening without a public official\u0026rsquo;s support. \u0026ldquo;Gration appears to be working very hard to get feedback,\u0026rdquo; Clarke said.\nEngaging more than one organization made the proposal more attractive to public officials. Save Darfur asked for the event, and the special envoy\u0026rsquo;s office suggested a representative of student activists join as well. Gration\u0026rsquo;s office wanted the event to be seen as legitimately representing the entire Sudan advocacy movement, not simply a single pressure group.\nCautious criticism seemed to have paid off in helping make the dialogue possible. Many Sudan advocacy organizations including STAND and Save Darfur have been publicly supportive of the special envoy, while continuing to push for more transparency and specifics. Gration had been criticized by some activists as \u0026ldquo;naive\u0026rdquo; with some going so far as demanding his resignation, but responses from Save Darfur and STAND\u0026rsquo;s parent organization, the Genocide Intervention Network, had largely not suggested that level of displeasure. \u0026ldquo;I think that we don\u0026rsquo;t always agree with the special envoy\u0026rsquo;s office, but we maintain an open line of communication, and that has helped us a lot,\u0026rdquo; Clarke said.\nAs for the issue of Sudan, could pressure on legislators coupled with Gration\u0026rsquo;s limited responses provoke more Congressional action? The online event with Gration directly followed a conference for anti-genocide activists, including a full day of meetings with members of Congress. Diamond-Falk pointed out that following the student lobbying and live webchat, 44 members of Congress signed a letter to President Obama ahead of his visit to China, a major trading partner of Sudan\u0026rsquo;s, urging the president to make Sudan a priority in his discussions there.\nClarke said if a second online Q\u0026amp;A occurs, Save Darfur \u0026ldquo;will be pushing for questions that are extremely direct from those who are suffering on the ground,\u0026rdquo; suggesting the event can not only be a chance to connect activists to the administration, but survivors of the genocide and wars in Sudan as well.\nUpdate: Bec Hamilton reported that a former State Department official had called Sudan activists \u0026ldquo;noise we had to manage,\u0026rdquo; and I mistakenly attributed it to current State Department officials; it\u0026rsquo;s been corrected in the text above.\n"},"name":"Government accountability through web 2.0: A case study","photo":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/11/government-accountability-through-web-20-case-study/meeting-feet_flickr-mripp.jpg","published":"2009-11-13T00:00:00Z","summary":"Last week, Special Envoy to Sudan Gen.

From Causes\u0026rsquo; point of view, MySpace was probably more trouble than it was worth given the percentage of their total users, though I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call nearly 200,000 people a \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; number.\nCauses on Facebook had, from the beginning, more to offer nonprofits than its MySpace version. Nonprofits could, for instance, send email messages to all their Causes supporters on Facebook \u0026ndash; something not possible using Fan Pages or Facebook Groups over 2,000 people. On MySpace, probably due to the limitations of the network itself, there was no such functionality.\nIn fact, in one of my first write-ups on using social networks for fundraising and advocacy, I highlighted Causes not as a great way to fundraise but as a great way to engage members. There was less chance for engagement on MySpace; though supporters could still put up a badge demonstrating their support and make donations, in my experience those were actually the least useful parts of Causes. As I wrote earlier this year:\nSomeone who expects Causes \u0026ndash; or any social networking approach \u0026ndash; to replace their development director doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand the nature of social networks. It\u0026rsquo;s not about building a more effective ATM \u0026ndash; sorry, \u0026ldquo;donor list\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s about cultivating relationships with your most passionate supporters, giving them ways to speak in their own voice and connecting them with other people.\nMost young folks who are on social networks get this, since it\u0026rsquo;s how they\u0026rsquo;re relating socially on these networks already. (As danah boyd has said, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not addicted to computers, we\u0026rsquo;re addicted to friends.\u0026rdquo;)\nAgain, I suspect this was a limitation imposed by MySpace, so I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily fault Causes. The lesson here, though, is that a fundraising widget is not enough of a draw. The chance for engaging supporters \u0026ndash; not just in things like one-way email blasts but in things like leaderboards showing the top fundraisers among supporter-created Causes \u0026ndash; is, in the end, the \u0026ldquo;killer\u0026rdquo; part of this app.\nWhat this means for nonprofits on MySpaceDespite repeated claims that MySpace is \u0026ldquo;dead,\u0026rdquo; I continue to think it\u0026rsquo;s a smart move for many nonprofits to have a presence there.\nSociologist danah boyd has documented the clear socioeconomic differences between MySpace and Facebook, and Amy Sample Ward has stressed the need to know your community and where it is. Facebook, after all, was built by and for middle- and owning-class college-educated folks \u0026ndash; exactly those people who fill nonprofit staffs. But if your organization serves a different community, then simply going where your staff is familiar might not be the best choice.\nFor those who want to do peer-to-peer fundraising on MySpace, there are still widgets like ChipIn available for that purpose. They won\u0026rsquo;t have the \u0026ldquo;built-in\u0026rdquo; feel that Causes on MySpace did, but they\u0026rsquo;re fairly easy to guide people through with a quick training or video.\nWhat this means for nonprofit fundraising on social networksThe bigger lesson here is that you can\u0026rsquo;t rely on third-party, often for-profit services to support your organization\u0026rsquo;s interests. To Causes, leaving MySpace to focus on its core community on Facebook made good business sense, but certainly those organizations left in the lurch on MySpace feel otherwise.\nI think Rebecca Leaman said it best \u0026ndash; don\u0026rsquo;t put \u0026ldquo;all fundraising eggs in one third-party basket!\u0026rdquo; These services are useful, and can help your organization advance its mission, but it\u0026rsquo;s not accountable to you \u0026ndash; and you need to have other options.\nLetting go of your message, holding on to your relationshipsI (and many others) have often said that in order to be successful in social media, nonprofits need to be willing to give up some control over their message \u0026ndash; to let supporters speak in their own voice. What Causes\u0026rsquo; move has exposed, though, is that while it\u0026rsquo;s important to let go of your message, you still need to have control over your relationships.\nNonprofits don\u0026rsquo;t own or even control the connections they have with their supporters in these spaces \u0026ndash; the comments, messages, badges and memberships of supporters within social networks are all locked within those social networks and are used under contract (terms of service) from the social network.\nSystems like Facebook Connect or OpenSocial allow those relationships to be exposed elsewhere, but that\u0026rsquo;s not the same as control. If the social network or service decides the nonprofit has run afoul of the contract, or the company goes bankrupt, cancels services or features, or gets sold to a different company who does \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s nothing an organization will be able to do.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s important to have multiple channels of communication with supporters and to continually try to move people toward the center of your organization by deepening involvement, so that if you lose them in one space they don\u0026rsquo;t simply fade off into the ether.\nOpen-source, open data, open networksAmy Sample Ward makes some great points that social change communities may have to take the lead on technology by pushing for more openness and transparency. I\u0026rsquo;ve written before, for instance, that community blogs run better on open-source software, and I think in principle the same is true for social networks.\nBut nonprofits and social change movements will always have to go where the supporters are \u0026ndash; and in many cases that will mean closed, proprietary, walled-garden social networks.\nWhat would it look like if nonprofits and social change movements \u0026ndash; which these third party applications often use to market themselves as effective and \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; started demanding some openness?\nIs it reasonable to assert that organizations and individuals should \u0026ldquo;own\u0026rdquo; their relationships, even when within a proprietary network? Can long-term social change happen when connections must be re-built on each new online social network to be developed?\nWhile Causes on MySpace may be no more, I think this event raises some important questions for the relationship between nonprofits, social change, and for-profit software and services. What are your thoughts?\nUpdate: I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen Read Write Web\u0026rsquo;s coverage of this, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth a read. As I say above, I think Causes\u0026rsquo; supposed \u0026ldquo;failures\u0026rdquo; to raise tons of money for nonprofits is less of an issue than some might think (for a great perspective on this, see Allison Fine). But as many of the commenters suggest, the way forward is to explore mechanisms for open-sourcing our relationships from these closed, proprietary systems, be they widgets like Causes or networks like Facebook and MySpace.\n"},"name":"Causes abandons 184,674 nonprofit supporters on MySpace","photo":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/11/causes-abandons-184674-nonprofit-supporters-myspace/abandoned-train_flickr-cindy47452.jpg","published":"2009-11-06T00:00:00Z","summary":"You can\u0026#39;t rely on third-party, often for-profit services to support your organization\u0026#39;s interests.

Those with more experience may seek to inspire or ask questions to further dialogue, but as a way to further develop strategy rather than dictate to or control the masses.\nAttempting to liberate the oppressed without their reflective participation in the act of liberation is to treat them as objects which must be saved from a burning building; it is to lead them into the populist pitfall and transform them into masses which can be manipulated. \u0026hellip; [T]he oppressed must see themselves as women and men engaged in the \u0026hellip; vocation of becoming more fully human.2\nThis may seem like heavy or strident language in the context of online petition drives or peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns. But my goal is to push social change organizers to look toward the larger picture. What sort of movement do you want to build in the long-term? What role do people play in that movement \u0026ndash; is it a passive one of letter-signing and donation-giving, or an active one of working from the ground up for lasting change?\nSelling, Giving and CultivatingWant to support online organizing? Help promote a panel at SXSW 2010: Vote for us by the end of Friday!\nIvan Boothe is part of a proposed panel for the South by Southwest Interactive conference, \u0026ldquo;Connecting Communities for the Common Good: Owning Online Organizing,\u0026rdquo; along with Ben Rattray, founder of change.org; Peter Corbet with iStrategy Labs; Sally Kohn of the Center for Community Change; and moderated by Kari Dunn Saratovsky from the Case Foundation.\nWe need your help to get this panel on the schedule! Please consider voting for the panel at SXSW (quick registration required). Additionally, please leave a comment on the panel\u0026rsquo;s page. Voting accounts for only about 30% of the decision to include a panel, so we want to demonstrate support for discussion around online organizing with your comments.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with the process, here\u0026rsquo;s a step-by-step guide to voting from the Case Foundation. There\u0026rsquo;s no limit to the number of panels you can vote for, so check out Beth Kanter\u0026rsquo;s list of nptech panel proposals and share the love!\nSocial marketing experts are adept at building brand loyalty, or encouraging the formation of an identity around an issue. They know how to sell the idea of \u0026ldquo;social good\u0026rdquo; to the public at large, using people\u0026rsquo;s goodwill toward a cause as a way to market to them through a given company, and increase donations to a partner charity. Well-known examples of this are the RED campaign and Starbucks' Ethos Water.\nOnline organizers turn a skeptical eye toward \u0026ldquo;social good\u0026rdquo; and social marketing. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean such projects aren\u0026rsquo;t worth exploring or learning from, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that everyone involved is a charlatan simply out to make a buck. But selling people an identity, even a \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; one, is fundamentally different from organizing for social change. Freire again: \u0026ldquo;Conviction cannot be packaged and sold; it is reached, rather, by means of a totality of reflection and action.3\nMovement building also goes beyond electoral organizing. Folks working for social change often form common cause with those organizing around a political candidate, and there is of course much to be learned and shared between the two practices. But whereas elections are centered around a single charismatic leader, a fully-engaged, vibrant social change movement consists of both shared vision and shared leadership. Elections give people an answer, while movements ask people a question \u0026ndash; and then encourage them to speak for themselves.\nInstead of selling or giving supporters a solution, then, online organizers are involved in cultivation. There are pieces of both social marketing and electoral organizing present in online organizing, of course, and experts in these fields can be a useful source of data, but we should be wary of replicating these other models when it comes to leadership.\nNetwork WisdomThere is a developing praxis being explored by numerous thinkers and strategists in online organizing. For sociological analyses \u0026ndash; stories and experiences \u0026ndash; danah boyd is indispensible. Clay Shirky, Allison Fine, Valdis Krebs and Howard Rheingold explore the power of networks of individuals, while Beth Kanter, DigiActive and Debra Askanase provide concrete case studies of online organizing in action.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s your experience? Who are online organizers with whom you share successes and strategies? Please offer your wisdom in the comments!\nLike the idea of discussing and strategizing about online organizing? Please vote for \u0026ndash; and even more importantly, leave a positive comment on \u0026ndash; the online organizing panel proposal for SXSW.

As noted above,\nworking-class communities, communities of color, folks with less formal\neducation and various kinds of \u0026ldquo;marginalized\u0026rdquo; groups interact with online social\nnetworks very differently, often because of stronger real-world social networks.\nThe best organizing strategy activates people through all their social\nconnections, whether online or offline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"final-thoughts\" class=\"link_owner\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEngaging supporters on social networks is long-term.\u003c/strong\u003e Don\u0026rsquo;t expect\nimmediate results.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt takes effort.\u003c/strong\u003e You need to be willing to communicate, in both\ndirections, with your supporters.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you want your members to spread your message, you have to trust them.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeedback in the comments below is welcome!

Thanks, Beth! Be sure to check out her We Are Media wiki for more resources and stories like this.\nUsing Social Networks for Social Change: Facebook, MySpace and MoreI had planned to present a slideshow along with my talk, but in fact, technical difficulties prevented me from doing so. The presentation posted on Slideshare is thus a recreation of that talk, with the audio keyed to the slides. (Update July 14, 2022: Some years back, Slideshare deleted all audio from presentations. At some point I recovered the audio, but in the intervening time I appear to have lost it again. Apologies!) For those of you who prefer things in textual form, I\u0026rsquo;ll write out most of it below, but I encourage you to at least page through the slides for the pictures.\nMany of the points I make in the presentation draw on things I\u0026rsquo;ve written on this site; I\u0026rsquo;ve linked to some of these articles in the body of the presentation below.\nJump directly to the success stories:\nUsing Online Student Pressure to Pass Legislation A Photo Petition Puts Students at the Heart of a Congressional Briefing How Social Networks Can Coordinate a Fundraising Drive A Mission to EmpowerThe Genocide Intervention Network is an organization that I helped form in college, and where I worked as director of communications and Internet strategy coordinator from 2004–2008. The mission of the organization is to empower members with tools to prevent and stop genocide.\nThe idea of \u0026ldquo;empowerment\u0026rdquo; is key to the organization\u0026rsquo;s mission, and undergirds our approach to social networks and social media. GI-Net wants members who can think for themselves, and consequently social networking is a key method by which the organization helps train supporters to speak for themselves, for us, and for an anti-genocide movement.\nMany groups use social networks for mobilizing \u0026ndash; getting members out to an evnt, getting people to sign a petition, getting people to donate for a cause. GI-Net focuses on organizing \u0026ndash; creating an educated constituency of people who can motivate others.\nWhen we first arrived on Facebook in 2005, for example, there were already dozens of groups about the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. So it was much more about giving supporters tools to take effective action than it was about convincing people to join our cause. Social networks are an integral part of an organizing strategy, because communication and engagement are what they\u0026rsquo;re all about.\nWeaving Your Social WebThe dynamics and demographics of each social network are different \u0026ndash; what may make sense on MySpace could be seen as annoying on Facebook. If you have a specific niche, you might try focused networks like BlackPlanet, Eons, GLEE, WiserEarth or The Hub (Update, Aug. 18, 2010: The Hub has been retired).\nFor a sociological study of these different kinds of networks, check out the writings of danah boyd. Interestingly, many nonprofit professionals see Facebook as the \u0026ldquo;more interesting\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;more useful\u0026rdquo; social network as compared to MySpace, and that\u0026rsquo;s largely because, indeed, Facebook is designed to appeal to the predominant class and educational backgrounds of these folks. Depending on an organization\u0026rsquo;s constituency, however, MySpace might actually be a better way to reach your supporters. Don\u0026rsquo;t decide where to organize online based on which site you or your executive director personally think is most appealing.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re determining which network(s) to organize on, the key thing to remember is that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be everywhere. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s often better if you start with just one \u0026ndash; get your bearings, try out some different approaches, and become thoughtfully engaged with your community of supporters there. You need to make a commitment to each network you join; there\u0026rsquo;s nothing worse (or more unprofessional looking) than a clearly-abandoned organizational profile, where messages go unanswered and spam comments go unmoderated.\nSocial Media and Social NetworksSocial media (e.g. YouTube and Flickr) often integrate particularly well with social networks (e.g. Facebook and MySpace), as a way to help engage members and heighten interest. Why not simply upload your own images and host your own videos? The \u0026ldquo;social\u0026rdquo; in social media ensures that, if you post your media with useful titles, descriptions and keywords, other people may well discover you who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t otherwise have encountered you \u0026ndash; and you\u0026rsquo;ll draw them further into your social web.\nUsing Videos on MySpaceWhen we first put our profile up on MySpace, we were getting one or two friend requests a day, and that\u0026rsquo;s not too bad for just starting off. As soon as we put up a short video about the organization \u0026ndash; posted via YouTube, in the hopes of drawing in people from that site as well \u0026ndash; our friend requests went up to 10–15 per day. Supporters could embed the videos in their own profiles themselves. That\u0026rsquo;s the advantage of social media in social networks: People are drawn to photos and video, and the nature of social networking allows them to easily share them with friends.\nKeys to Success on Social Networks It\u0026rsquo;s about member engagement. You might notice there\u0026rsquo;s only one key: Facilitating conversations between and among your supporters. Ultimately, getting an excited base of supporters begins with having them talk to each other about what they\u0026rsquo;re doing around an issue.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really not a billboard. You need to cultivate relationships with your supporters.\nThe Money ThingSocial networks are not going to replace your development director. Even when you do raise money, it\u0026rsquo;s usually more about member engagement than it is about a significant revenue stream. GI-Net\u0026rsquo;s experience with Causes, a platform on Facebook and MySpace, was that \u0026ldquo;fundraisers\u0026rdquo; were actually a great way to give supporters something concrete to work toward \u0026ndash; but that it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been a very significant source of donations. Nonetheless, the social aspect to it ensures that members who do participate become even more engaged and are often willing to help spearhead the next advocacy campaign.\nThe top Cause on Facebook had, as of June 2008, more than 3 million members but only raised about $50,000; the vast majority of nonprofits using Causes hadn\u0026rsquo;t raised more than a few hundred dollars. Innovative fundraising campaigns using social networks may bear fruit financially, but member engagement is almost always going to be the primary goal in the end.\nLet Your People Speak\u0026hellip;Causes is also a good illustration of another point: You need to let your supporters speak for you on social networks. GI-Net set up an \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; Cause on Facebook, but a member-created Cause benefiting us has more than twice the number of supporters. We could have tried to shut down the unofficial group in an effort to control our message, but instead we reached out to the creator \u0026ndash; who was more than willing to send out alerts anyway \u0026ndash; and found ways to engage our supporters while still recognizing their own creativity.\nThe whole point of the social experience is the coveted \u0026ldquo;recommendation from a friend.\u0026rdquo; Forcing your members to send out only board-approved talking points won\u0026rsquo;t inspire much loyalty, and probably won\u0026rsquo;t be very persuasive to their friends. Nonprofits have to be willing to lose some of their message control in exchange for member loyalty. Trust me \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s worth the trade-off.\n\u0026hellip;And Then Listen to What They SayOn our MySpace profile, we have a prominent newsletter-signup form at the top of the screen. But we don\u0026rsquo;t simply cut-and-paste our blast emails directly to the MySpace crowd. For one of our MySpace blogs, we said the following:\nAre you active in your community on anti-genocide issues? Raising money for civilian protection in Darfur \u0026ndash; educating your neighbors about the mass atrocities in Burma \u0026ndash; working to pass divestment from Sudan in your state? Leave us a comment and describe what you\u0026rsquo;re doing!\nWe want you in our top friends!\nIn the coming weeks, we\u0026rsquo;ll be rotating in all of our MySpace friends who are active on anti-genocide issues into our top friends. You\u0026rsquo;ve been supporting us, now we want to support you!\nOn MySpace, putting someone in your \u0026ldquo;top friends\u0026rdquo; is a way of showing thanks and respect, and it was an easy thing to do. We heard from a dozen different local activists who were all featured, some of whom ended up being key leaders on future advocacy campaigns. Show your supporters that you\u0026rsquo;re listening to them, and they\u0026rsquo;ll reward you!\nThis approach \u0026ndash; what\u0026rsquo;s sometimes called \u0026ldquo;user-generated content\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; is a fantastic way to converse with supporters on social networks. Ask people for their stories, photos, videos or other creative work, and then feature some or all of that content. You\u0026rsquo;ll end up with more dedicated members who are willing to take the next step; after having been engaged on a small issue (\u0026ldquo;take a picture of your fundraiser for Darfur\u0026rdquo;) they\u0026rsquo;ll be willing to lead on a larger one (\u0026ldquo;help organize a local visit to your member of Congress\u0026rdquo;).\nSuccess Story 1: Using Online Student Pressure to Pass LegislationIn 2005, there was an anti-genocide bill that was being held up by a Senate committee chair. Using Facebook, GI-Net identified and reached out to students in that senator\u0026rsquo;s home state.\nInstead of having the students contact the senator directly, we guided the students in a process of using the website OpenSecrets.org to determine the senator\u0026rsquo;s top campaign donors. The students called those donors and asked them to contact the senator and say that standing up against genocide is a moral imperative, and that the senator should move the bill.\nThe result: Two weeks later, the bill was passed by the committee, was approved by the full Senate, and eventually was signed into law.\nSuccess Story 2: A Photo Petition Puts Students at the Heart of a Congressional BriefingGI-Net\u0026rsquo;s student division, STAND, initiated a campaign called \u0026ldquo;Picture a World Without Genocide,\u0026rdquo; in which they encouraged high school students to submit photos via Facebook and MySpace of their activism on Darfur. Hundreds of pictures were collected and compiled into a large poster spelling out the word \u0026ldquo;Darfur.\u0026rdquo;\nWe presented this poster at a Capitol Hill briefing, in conjunction with a report we were releasing about congressional action on Darfur. We had prepared the report, and originally we were going to do a traditional press conference in which we called out Congress for their inaction.\nWe decided to couple the release of this report with this visible manifestation of student activism, as a way to keep our members engaged. In the weeks following the event, the numbers of co-sponsors for key legislation increased substantially \u0026ndash; and because students had been \u0026ldquo;part of the action,\u0026rdquo; they were able to claim part of the victory.\nIn fact, even if no new co-sponsors had signed on, the action still would have been a great way to activate supporters, so it was really a no-lose campaign for us.\nA Worldwide Photo Gallery in 24 HoursWhen coordinated rallies focusing on Darfur were set up by the Save Darfur Coalition (of which GI-Net is a part), we encouraged our members to take part \u0026ndash; and take pictures. Then we had them upload their images to the photosharing site Flickr, along with a special tag, or keyword, for that event. Using Flickr\u0026rsquo;s own system, we could then pull images with that tag onto GI-Net\u0026rsquo;s website in a constantly-updated, rotating gallery of Darfur activism the day after the event.\nTotal time on our part? About 15 minutes to write the email to our members, and 10 minutes to put the gallery on our website.\nSuccess Story 3: How Social Networks Can Coordinate a Fundraising DriveSTAND\u0026rsquo;s annual \u0026ldquo;DarfurFast\u0026rdquo; encourages students on one day to refrain from one luxury item, and donate the proceeds to GI-Net\u0026rsquo;s Darfur protection program. We engage people around the campaign on several different channels, including Facebook, MySpace, LiveJournal and Twitter.\nSocial networks were a key way to keep supporters engaged \u0026ndash; as well as inviting friends on campus to take part in the real-world upcoming events. The key is that the person-to-person networks already existed in the form of chapters and campus networks; online social networks simply facilitated an easier invitation to friends.\nSo, we raised more than $500,000 over the course of three years with this event; 2007 saw participation from 450 high schools and 300 colleges. But it\u0026rsquo;s very unlikely we would have ever raised that kind of money via Facebook et al. alone \u0026ndash; the online social networks simply supplemented the on-the-ground organizing we (and campus leaders) had already been doing. In fact, online social networks are probably most strategically useful when the event is offline, allowing supporters to quickly spread the word well ahead of time.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth mentioning that many of these methods worked particularly well because they centered on students, who are most active on these networks, generally have easy access to computers and are more likely to have free time. While GI-Net has a constituency far beyond students alone (and sometimes reaches those constituencies directly through networks like Eons), you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily expect these kinds of returns from everyone. As noted above, working-class communities, communities of color, folks with less formal education and various kinds of \u0026ldquo;marginalized\u0026rdquo; groups interact with online social networks very differently, often because of stronger real-world social networks. The best organizing strategy activates people through all their social connections, whether online or offline.\nFinal Thoughts Engaging supporters on social networks is long-term. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect immediate results. It takes effort. You need to be willing to communicate, in both directions, with your supporters. If you want your members to spread your message, you have to trust them. Feedback in the comments below is welcome!

Drupal is a free, open-source content management system that allows non-technical users to update your site and is capable of powering blogs, community sites, action-oriented campaigns and social networks along the lines of MySpace and Facebook. Lullabot, a Drupal development firm that involved in much of the Drupal development, has a keen interest in Drupal for nonprofits.\nIn return for NetSquared\u0026rsquo;s generosity, I wanted to post some tips for nonprofits thinking about using Drupal for their sites. I\u0026rsquo;m convinced that, under most circumstances, Drupal can be a powerful resource for online advocacy and social change.\nBackgroundTo date, I have built four full-fledged sites with Drupal for the Genocide Intervention Network:\nAsk the Candidates (Drupal version 5) Darfur Congressional Scorecard (v4.7) Time to Protect (v4.7) Power to Protect (v4.6) GI-Net\u0026rsquo;s main site was also developed in Drupal (v4.7) by an outside firm, as was GI-Net\u0026rsquo;s student site, STAND (v4.7).\nMy personal site is in Drupal (v5) and I\u0026rsquo;m working on releasing an e-commerce site and a community events site in the near future.\nAlthough I have a working knowledge of basic PHP, on which Drupal is based, my work primarily is in HTML and CSS \u0026ndash; for the majority of things our sites need to do, it\u0026rsquo;s mainly a matter of finding the right modules (plugins) and then themeing (designing) the site to look the way we want. By and large you don\u0026rsquo;t need to have a lot of programming knowledge to create effective sites in Drupal.\nWhen to Use Drupal \u0026ndash; and When Not to Use itDrupal has a number of strengths:\nOnce you understand the terminology and basic structure of Drupal, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to set up sites relatively quickly, with advanced functionality simply \u0026ldquo;dropped in\u0026rdquo; by way of modules. Drupal is relatively easy to theme, especially in version 5 and even more so in the upcoming version 6 (likely to be released in early 2008). Drupal is extremely search-engine friendly, helping get your site to the top of search engine lists with minimal effort. With a few tweaks and additional modules, it can be even more effective. Drupal is relatively scalable, able to power large sites as well as small. For very high-traffic sites, this will take some tweaking of the server settings, but this is true for pretty much any content management system (CMS). It\u0026rsquo;s free! More importantly, it has a large, robust community of developers regularly updating both its core features and plug-in modules \u0026ndash; also for free! And when you can\u0026rsquo;t swing the free-software cost \u0026ndash; staff time \u0026ndash; there are plenty of Drupal developers out there. For nonprofits looking to \u0026ldquo;act out\u0026rdquo; social change, Drupal is a welcome addition to for-profit corporations upon which you have to depend for any updates or bug fixes. Because it\u0026rsquo;s open-source, Drupal won\u0026rsquo;t lock you in to a proprietary system that mangles your data or makes it difficult to switch to another CMS in the future. Additionally, it\u0026rsquo;s open nature allows for more frequent integration with other software and web services \u0026ndash; everything from Flickr to Salesforce, with rumors of Democracy in Action on the way. Of special note, Drupal has tight integration with CiviCRM and equally free, open-source contact relationship manager (also available for the Joomla CMS). If you opt to use CiviCRM as your CRM for donors or members, you can aggregate useful data like donations through the website, membership dues, attendance at events, subscriptions to mailing lists and participation in local groups, as well as the usual searching, sorting and categorizing of contacts available in any CRM. For you geeks out there, it uses standards compliant (at least in core) semantic code and is built on the MVC model. Many prominent sites, both commercial and nonprofit, have been built on Drupal, including MTV.co.uk, Sen. Chris Dodd, The Onion and NetSquared itself (see a full list).\nOne of my favorites, just recently released, is WITNESS\u0026rsquo;s The Hub, built by the fine folks at CivicActions. (The Hub was also a proposal for the 2007 NetSquared Conference.) I think The Hub really shows the potential for social change that Drupal-powered sites can accomplish.\nWhen might you not want to use Drupal?\nFor those completely new to Drupal, it can have a significant learning curve. We\u0026rsquo;re not talking Photoshop here, but much of the terminology and structure of the site can be unfamiliar to new users, even those familiar with other CMSes. If you need a hot website tomorrow and can\u0026rsquo;t spring for a paid developer, it might make more sense to go with a CMS you already know. Drupal is an excellent platform for blogs, and allows you to build in a lot of community and social-networking features that can strengthen your blog\u0026rsquo;s appeal. However, WordPress, another free open-source software, is specifically oriented toward blogs. The learning curve is significantly less, and it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat easier to theme (design). If you\u0026rsquo;re primarily a designer and you want a straightforward blog site without having to ever see a line of PHP code, WordPress may well be a better option. Like Drupal, it has an excellent community of developers and contributers, and many of its plugins can also stretch its capabilities to encompass social-networking-oriented functions. If you absolutely need a website tomorrow \u0026ndash; a simple blog or \u0026ldquo;brochureware\u0026rdquo; site giving the basics of a new campaign and a place to post updates and press releases, your best bet may be Joomla. Like Drupal and WordPress, it\u0026rsquo;s free, open-source and has lots of developers, many of them involved in nonprofits and advocacy campaigns. It is somewhat harder to design to not look like \u0026ldquo;a Joomla site\u0026rdquo; but there\u0026rsquo;s no question that it\u0026rsquo;s faster to set up and publish a simple website. Free software is great and all, but if you have no budget and no design or programming resources in-house, you may want to stick with that commercial CMS you know \u0026ndash; or even Dreamweaver or FrontPage sites. The cost of free software is the development time, and that isn\u0026rsquo;t an insignificant concern.

Drupal Resources for NonprofitsDrupal for Good is the primary Drupal-centered site for nonprofit and charitable discussions. (For the mischievous, there\u0026rsquo;s also Drupal for Evil.)

And for us, conversations are the perfect way to build a vibrant, effective movement.\nWhen GI-Net began, we were primary student-oriented, and so organizing in places like Facebook was really a necessity. But as we grew, it became clear that focusing on these types of networks, in which we were able to supply members with knowledge but they were also empowered to speak for themselves, could be a powerful way to grow our impact exponentially.\nIn fact, effective social movements have always been based on affective social ties, and fears of postmodern atomization aside, twenty-first century movements won\u0026rsquo;t be any different.\nWhen I first started writing about this, however, I explained an important requirement for engagement in the social web to succeed \u0026ndash; and this is still true for us today:\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a mentality shift required to fully engage with social networking and community content sites: sometimes, you have to let go. It\u0026rsquo;s true that someone could start posting pictures on Flickr of irrelevant things and tag them \u0026ldquo;antigenocide,\u0026rdquo; or that some of our biggest fans hosting the YouTube video on MySpace might have profiles that would make some of our donors cringe.\nPerhaps even more significantly, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that some of the people who encounter us on these sites never make it to our main website, never sign up for a newsletter, never complete an action, and never make a donation.\nFor us, it goes back to our mission: to empower our members to prevent and stop genocide, and in so doing, to create an educated anti-genocide constituency.\nWhile we do, of course, want to increase our membership rolls and make ever-larger donations to civilian protection, in some respects it\u0026rsquo;s not always necessary for people to perform every anti-genocide action through our organization.\nIf our videos or emails or profiles get people talking more substantially about genocide \u0026ndash; and the concrete ways in which they can actually prevent and stop genocide \u0026ndash; then in some sense whether they end up on our mailing list is somewhat beside the point. Through their knowledge they will engage others, and ultimately enhance the anti-genocide movement we\u0026rsquo;re helping to build.\nIn his profile of GI-Net and Catalyst Campaigns, Joshua Levy describes this approach as \u0026ldquo;similar to bottom-up, open-source collaborative projects,\u0026rdquo; and I think that\u0026rsquo;s exactly right. Our organization is engaged in a collaborative project with our members, and while we may have particular resources or acquired expertise, it\u0026rsquo;s really their activism and passion that will build and drive the movement.\nWhat it all comes down to is that we\u0026rsquo;re focusing on organizing people into a permanent anti-genocide movement (and much of that happens in a decentralized, self-organized sort of way) rather than simply mobilizing people for a particular event or campaign and then sending them home. If you just need bodies at a rally, names on a petition or donations in your coffers, mobilizing through traditional means will work great. But if you need an active, educated and effective movement, organizing through social webs has the potential to create much more lasting change.\nThe Genocide Intervention Network on the Social Web MySpace Facebook change.org LiveJournal Twitter Flickr YouTube Previous Articles Using Social Networking to Stop Genocide (Idealware), on the origins of GI-Net\u0026rsquo;s approach.

Colin began by offering an example of a participatory-media approach that had backfired for a corporation, the anti-Chevy Chevy Tahoe ad. (This ad campaign would also show up in Marty\u0026rsquo;s presentation.)\nColin pointed out that Chevy had decided to leave the ads online because they had the effect of driving lots of traffic to the website \u0026ndash; thus turning a negative backlash into a positive result. In his presentation, however, Marty said there had been a significant drop in sales of the Tahoe the next quarter \u0026ndash; possibly due to the rise in gas prices, but possibly also due to this negative publicity.\nAfter recommending that campaigns engage in participatory media for the simple reason that your users are doing it anyway (giving the example of the \u0026ldquo;vote different\u0026rdquo; video), Colin outlined the basic motivations:\nengagement leveraging collective intelligence (Marty might call this being network-centric) publicity because they\u0026rsquo;re there Colin pointed out that email discussion lists and fora were a basic form of user-generated content. Beyond that lay blogs, then video and photographs, altered images, stories, social networking projects and \u0026ldquo;ideas\u0026rdquo; themselves.\nThere are several levels of engagement possible with participatory media:\nobservation (one-way, receiving information) interaction (responding with information, as in a blog comment) contribution (creating information, as in posting a blog) solicitation (asking others to create information in response to yours, as in a video response or a contest) A prime example of participatory media that Colin gave was Late Night with Conan O\u0026rsquo;Brien\u0026rsquo;s HornyManatee.com. The site solicits hot manatee action from its users, to great effect.\nMichael then took the helm, demonstrating two participatory media campaigns EchoDitto had worked on (which coincidentally both won awards): Since Sliced Bread and the Pearl Harbor Survivors Project.\nFor the Survivors Project, Michael talked about the strategizing they had done in order to collect the stories of the several-hundred remaining survivors of the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. They had set up a toll-free number so that technologically-challenged seniors wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to interface with the website, but to their surprise that was the primary mode of submission. In another twist, they established a MySpace profile not expecting much response from a youthful crowd, but soon went on to find 20,000 friend requests.\nMichael pointed out that the nature of participatory media was still new enough that it is able to earn media for the organization \u0026ndash; the Survivors Project really took off after a feature in Parade. The very existence of the campaign was a news story, in a way a traditional museum-style exhibit on Pearl Harbor would not be.\nAs for Since Sliced Bread, Michael explained that it was an attempt by SEIU president Andy Stern to solicit ideas directly from workers, because he felt like DC lobbyists and consultants working on labor issues weren\u0026rsquo;t concerned with the real issues facing his union members.\nUsers were thus invited to submit their best ideas Since Sliced Bread, with the winner receiving a prize of $100,000 and runners-up receiving money as well.

The site also generated some serious victories as well, including the winning project going on to being approved by voters in a Washington state ballot initiative.\nIn the question-and-answer period, numerous participatory media campaigns were offered, including the March of Dimes' Share Your Story and the Picture the Cure (cached copy, site seems down) initiative for the Canadian Cancer Society. Alan Rosenblatt said Care2 had done a study demonstrating that people who participated in discussion fora were 74% more likely to take action.\nOn to the second session!Marty began by making the argument that the differences in social networks (connections) today \u0026ndash; aptly covered by David Weinberger earlier in the day \u0026ndash; should necessarily change the way we go about social organizing. It is not as much about building individual leadership or organizational capacity, he said, but about making strong and effective connections.\nIn other words, what would your organization do with 10,000 people for ten minutes?\nMost people today are under a barrage of information.

Now, those voices are breaking through without the need for these nonprofits \u0026ndash; a potentially threatening prospect.\nThat made me think about the different kinds of \u0026ldquo;elites\u0026rdquo; that social movements and social networks engender.

They have a strong hold on direct power, though has been shown through nonviolent conflict and the \u0026ldquo;paradox of repression\u0026rdquo; (think of the dictators overthrown by popular movements) they nonetheless depend on a limited sort of consent from those over whom they rule. Resource elites are those who have the infrastructure (or the capacity to develop it) to make things possible \u0026ndash; be that change or stasis. Traditionally this has been people with the most money or natural resources; a relevant aspect of this today would be people (or communities) with the most access to technology. Idea elites are the ideological leaders who emerge, either hierarchically or communally, from a given social movement. These are the people who develop policy and drive debates \u0026ndash; but much of their power comes from the movement itself; while they can lead to a limited extent, they are always in danger of losing their power to the next big thinker.

I think focusing on these different kinds of elites allows for something closer to Paolo Freire\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;cointentional education\u0026rdquo; in which everyone is a student and liberation is bound up together.\nUpdate: Ethan Zuckerman makes a related point in his presentation when he says the new mantra for advocacy organizations should be: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t speak.

Why War? was a prominent site for news and analysis against the war (first Afghanistan, and then Iraq). Its database from 2001–2004 is the most comprehensive accounting of articles and opinions on the war, resistance to it and the movements that arose on each side. We are most well-known, however, for a campaign that had little to do with the war.\nIn 2003, internal emails from the electronic voting machine manufacturer Diebold emerged that suggested the company had misled voting officials in numerous states about the security of its machines, had violated contracts with states by installing new software that had not been certified, and had knowingly implemented voting systems with severe security vulnerabilities. Investigative journalist Bev Harris and the UK Independent had documented some of the serious problems, but few had taken notice, and Harris had been repeatedly threatened by her ISP, fearful of repercussions from Diebold\u0026rsquo;s lawyers.\nA member of Why War? decided to post an archive of the internal files on his website. After Swarthmore threatened to shut off our Internet access in the face of baseless copyright infringement claims from Diebold, we initiated a global campaign of electronic civil disobedience, in which students at universities would post mirrors of the files on their own servers, staying ahead of each specious take-down request. Simultaneously, our friends in what would become FreeCulture.org sued Diebold through the Electronic Frontier Foundation for abusive copyright threats.\nThe combination of civil disobedience and civil action paid off handsomely. Within two months, Diebold backed down from their legal threats and resigned themselves to the damaging information about them now in the public domain. Suspicion of Diebold and other electronic voting machine manufacturers \u0026ndash; and, thus, consistent investigation into their practices \u0026ndash; remains high.\nBack to genocideSo how does the Genocide Intervention Network use the Internet to effect social change? There are three primary ways.\nFirst, we raise money online directly for peacekeepers in Darfur. This is unprecedented \u0026ndash; never before has the average person been able to directly affect human security in the midst of a genocide. We raise money through a variety of techniques such as virtual house parties (a favorite among Facebook and MySpace users), dinners for Darfur and old-fashioned member volunteering. (A piano teacher in Utah giving two weeks\u0026rsquo; proceeds; a \u0026ldquo;battle of the bands\u0026rdquo; fundraiser in California; a bat mitzvah in New Jersey; a frat party in Massachusetts.)\nOur second component is education. People can\u0026rsquo;t act against genocide unless they know about it, which is why we partnered with the American Progress Action Fund in 2005 to launch the Be A Witness campaign, urging the news media to adequately cover the crisis in Darfur. Our analysis showed that in June 2005, the major networks ran 50 times as many stories about Michael Jackson and 12 times as many stories about Tom Cruise as about the genocide in Darfur. In fact, in all of 2005 CBS ran just two minutes \u0026ndash; total \u0026ndash; on the issue, a fact that motivated more than 30,000 viewers to take action through the viral video and website. Because of the paltry news coverage, we also issue weekly news reports from the ground in Darfur.\nFinally, we give our members the tools to advocate for protection in the face of genocide. We use Democracy in Action to direct our national campaigns, and work closely with the Sudan divestment task force at the state level. In April, we brought more than 850 students to Washington, D.C. as part of the Power to Protect: D.C. to Darfur weekend. The P2P website, which uses the Drupal open-source community platform, is key to sustaining these activists through the summer, when they will act as the catalysts for local anti-genocide groups in their hometowns.\nComing up nextWe are in the planning stages of a number of exciting online campaigns to further support the emerging anti-genocide movement. Our main website will be moved to Drupal to allow our members to connect with local leaders and organizations, and concretely affect the direction of the national campaigns.\nA photo petition, using ForwardTrack and our Flickr account, will put a human face on the victims in Darfur. Viewers will be asked to upload images of themselves holding a sign with \u0026ndash; not a comment or a pledge \u0026ndash; but the name of one of the hundreds of thousands of victims in Darfur. These photos will be delivered to members of Congress to show the depth of human involvement \u0026ndash; and human crisis \u0026ndash; around Darfur.\nMore than one of our members has asked us to be their designated charity for a marathon, and so our next fundraising tool will be a website to enable them to do just that. Members will be able to distribute information about the race and GI-Net, collect pledges online, and then follow-up with donors after the race.\nI would be happy to talk further with any of you about GI-Net or our ideas, but this post is already mighty long, so I\u0026rsquo;ll stop here. Thanks again for allowing me to come, and I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to seeing everyone!\nUpdate, Sept. 12, 2007: This blog post has been adapted into a chapter of the book Online social networking (2008), edited by Sylvia Engdahl, under the title \u0026ldquo;Online social networking is being used to oppose genocide.\u0026rdquo;\n"},"name":"Can blogging stop genocide?","photo":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2006/05/can-blogging-stop-genocide/pen-paper_flickr-maria_reyes-mcdavis.jpg","published":"2006-05-28T00:00:00Z","summary":"The Genocide Intervention Network is a nonprofit to change the way the world responds to genocide.

  <subtitle>I&#39;m into frontend engineering (especially back-of-the-frontend), creative social protest and radical nonviolent praxis. These things go together more than you think.</subtitle>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2014/04/join-me-devsigner-conference-portland-may-designers-developers-join-forces/&#34;&gt;quite a while&lt;/a&gt;
since I posted on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got out of the habit of posting through a combination of factors:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rootwork&#34;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; (as with everyone), shifting job
responsibilities, and adjusting my priorites to spend some of the time I used to
devote to work and work-adjacent things &amp;mdash; like blogging &amp;mdash; to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bellsofthecascades.org/about&#34;&gt;other pursuits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nonprofit-communications&#34;&gt;Nonprofit communications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014 I was primarily a freelancer working on Drupal websites. I had been
working at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://forusa.org/&#34;&gt;Fellowship of Reconciliation&lt;/a&gt;, an
interfaith peace and justice group, primarily as a web developer until then.
Increasingly that shifted into more online communications responsibilities. I
strategized for advocacy campaigns, planned out fundraising drives, and
supported content creation (not to mention
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20160419200729/http://forusa.org/blogs/ivan-boothe/honoring-active-nonviolence-us-middle-east/11909&#34;&gt;on-the-ground activism&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gratefully accepted
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20150407225011/http://www.nten.org/awards/2014/ntenny&#34;&gt;an NTENny award&lt;/a&gt;
from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nten.org/&#34;&gt;Nonprofit Technology Network&lt;/a&gt; in 2014 for some
of this work, and the presentations I gave at the annual Nonprofit Technology
Conference each year. (In 2015 I got to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/rootwork/saving-the-internet-with-the-internet-the-net-neutrality-victory-as-a-case-study&#34;&gt;introduce Fight for the Future and my friend Evan Greer&lt;/a&gt;
to a wider audience at the NTC.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;frontend-engineering-with-drupal&#34;&gt;Frontend engineering with Drupal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my work at FOR was fulfilling, they didn&amp;rsquo;t always have the budget to
support a full-time job for me. So in 2016 I joined
&lt;a href=&#34;https://colab.coop/&#34;&gt;CoLab Cooperative&lt;/a&gt; as a senior Drupal developer. I had a
great time doing styleguide&amp;ndash;driven development and component-based design
like &lt;a href=&#34;https://patternlab.io/&#34;&gt;PatternLab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As has been true throughout my career, I continued to center social justice as
the framing of my work. With CoLab&amp;rsquo;s support, I spoke on &amp;ldquo;Doing good with Drupal
and beyond&amp;rdquo; at the 2018
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pnwdrupalsummit.org&#34;&gt;Pacific Northwest Drupal Summit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(You can see
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanboothe/details/experience/1103947024/multiple-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAABl33EBS2mPp7MzOR78g03Gb0rtewlEVQw&amp;treasuryMediaId=1527283177501&#34;&gt;the slides on their own on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;old-websites-and-new-tools&#34;&gt;Old websites and new tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way back in the dark ages of the Internet &amp;mdash; 1996! &amp;mdash; I had built a
website for my parents&#39;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.titaniumringsforever.com/&#34;&gt;titanium wedding ring business&lt;/a&gt;. That
website continued to be updated, including moving onto Drupal Commerce in its
last two iterations, before finally being retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, they began selling a safer cleaning solution for titanium,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.multietch.com/&#34;&gt;Multi-Etch&lt;/a&gt;, and it became their primary business.
So after years of helping them out here and there, in 2020 they hired me
full-time as CIO. A little bit of my work involves web development, but a lot of
it is more along the lines of customer management and communications. It&amp;rsquo;s a
field I&amp;rsquo;ve had to learn a lot about, but it&amp;rsquo;s also given me time and tools to
broaden my technology experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, while I&amp;rsquo;m still a part of the Drupal community &amp;mdash; I
volunteered as a contribution mentor at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://events.drupal.org/portland2022&#34;&gt;DrupalCon Portland 2022&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;ve
spent the last few years learning a whole bunch of new skills. Some of those
include: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; (the static site generator now powering
rootwork.org),
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://css-tricks.com/front-of-the-front-back-of-the-front/&#34;&gt;back of the frontend&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
Node, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mjml.io/&#34;&gt;MJML&lt;/a&gt;. I also invested time in areas where I&amp;rsquo;d
wanted to get familiar for years: Bash scripting, SVGs and animation, and using
Linux as my daily workstation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those tools and technologies fit into my work with Multi-Etch in some
way, and as a result I have several projects spanning some of these areas that
I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share in coming blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;things-that-go-together&#34;&gt;Things that go together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/about/&#34;&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt; (now) says, I have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;worked as a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080131080116/http://www.genocideintervention.net/&#34;&gt;human rights advocate&lt;/a&gt;,
a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20111226083543/http://www.casinofreephilly.org:80/&#34;&gt;community organizer&lt;/a&gt;,
and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://forusa.org/&#34;&gt;nonprofit communications manager&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on
the board of a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.peacejusticestudies.org/&#34;&gt;justice studies association&lt;/a&gt;, helped
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.afsc.org/content/afsc-and-nobel-peace-prize&#34;&gt;nominate people for the Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt;,
wrote about
&lt;a href=&#34;https://works.swarthmore.edu/fac-soc-anth/29/&#34;&gt;third-party nonviolent intervention&lt;/a&gt;
and used
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20050204141450/https://www.why-war.com/features/2003/11/diebold_analyzed.html&#34;&gt;electronic civil disobedience to fight insecure voting systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that went alongside (and was often funded by) my technological work. But
as in the past, I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to write about
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2014/03/online-advocacy-learn-community-organizing/&#34;&gt;the intersections between activism and technology&lt;/a&gt;,
both the positive and negative. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll join me for the journey!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2022/09/refreshing-after-long-absence/&#34;&gt;Refreshing after a long absence&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re looking for folks to break out of their familiar meetup silos and apply
their knowledge across the crafts of development and design.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A transcript from my portion of the
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://14ntc.sched.com/event/10981233f5dfb1e3ca5a325d9bd19f81&#34;&gt;Big Idea&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
panel on &amp;ldquo;The Power of Technology in Advocacy and Organizing&amp;rdquo; from the 2014
Nonprofit Technology Conference, March 13-15 in Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update, March 6, 2015: Today I gave a similar presentation as part of the 2015
Nonprofit Technology Conference&amp;rsquo;s Ignite talks. You can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/rootwork/the-technology-of-social-change&#34;&gt;view the Slideshare&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2014/03/online-advocacy-learn-community-organizing/2015-03-06_technology-social-change.pdf&#34;&gt;download the PDF&lt;/a&gt;, but the slides
are simply images.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways this is a retelling of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2010/04/what-online-activism-can-learn-from-community-organizing/&#34;&gt;an article I wrote back in 2010&lt;/a&gt;
about online and offline organizing, with a more visual focus. If you prefer
words to images, the original might serve you better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;online-advocacy-and-community-organizing&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Online advocacy and community organizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My background is in community organizing and social movement theory, and that&amp;rsquo;s
what I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk a little bit about today.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In popular culture, we have two stories we usually tell about social change &amp;ndash;
two lenses in which we view advocacy and activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;img
      loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
      decoding=&#34;async&#34;
      alt=&#34;Charisma&#34;

        title=&#34; &#34;
      
    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is about a charismatic leader. Gandhi led India to freedom. Or Rosa
Parks, who one day was too tired to get up and inspired a city to boycott a
racist public policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;

        &lt;source srcset=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2014/03/online-advocacy-learn-community-organizing/2014004-ntc-b-0051280.webp %!s(&lt;nil&gt;)&#34; type=&#34;image/webp&#34;&gt;
        
        
    &lt;img
      loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
      decoding=&#34;async&#34;
      alt=&#34;Spontaneous&#34;

        title=&#34; &#34;
      
    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second story we tell is about a spontaneous event. Something shifted in the
world around us, and people responded in positive ways. Egyptians took to the
square to reclaim their democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;

    &lt;img
      loading=&#34;lazy&#34;

        title=&#34; &#34;
      
    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both of these stories have kernels of truth &amp;ndash; events happen, and people
inspire &amp;ndash; they are fundamentally not how social change occurs. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s
movement-building work that pushes change forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosa Parks wasn&amp;rsquo;t just tired &amp;ndash; she was trained.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Egyptian revolution didn&amp;rsquo;t just happen, it was preceded by years of student
organizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most successful social change movements didn&amp;rsquo;t just get lucky or figure out
how to use the newest tools, they were built through concerted strategic
planning. Our work for change can draw on that history and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalyst moments might be unplanned, but the infrastructure can be built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our organizations, we tend to privilege one set of actions over the other. We
focus on important task-based work like website development, fundraising,
communications, and the campaign strategy I just mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;

    &lt;img

    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s more to an organization and more to a movement than that. There&amp;rsquo;s
another group of endeavors sometimes called maintenance work, and it flies under
the radar even though it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to keeping our campaigns afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;

    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintenance work involves things like leadership development, facilitating
communication, conflict resolution, anti-oppression work, and visioning, the
things that fertilize our movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;

    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often privilege task work over maintenance work. Community knowledge and
strategic knowledge is devalued in favor of technical knowledge, because
technical knowledge can be more easily measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, movement-building work is disproportionately done by women, leaving
men in the &amp;ldquo;important&amp;rdquo; and visible roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its worst, a specialization of knowledge leads to accumulation of informal,
unacknowledged power through gatekeeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or to put it another way, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll launch that campaign when I&amp;rsquo;m ready to update

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our organizations, we should be striving toward social change, not startup
culture. We should cultivate sustainable work. We should commit to
anti-oppression work so we don&amp;rsquo;t replicate the unequal society we&amp;rsquo;re trying to
improve. We should provide benefits rather than relying on a precarious
workforce of independent contractors. We should &lt;em&gt;pay our interns&lt;/em&gt;. We should
allow staff to unionize, or become a worker-owned collective.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in general, we should remember that social change is not a business. We
should be ruthless in stealing ideas from the business community, but we should
not expect them to work for us just because they made people some money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, my one piece of advice is in addition to all the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/tags/twitter/&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; guides and fundraising how-tos in your tool belt,
explore some movement history. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Poor People&amp;rsquo;s Movements&lt;/em&gt; about work
against economic injustice, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve Got the Light of Freedom&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Southern Labor
and Black Civil Rights&lt;/em&gt; about the black-led freedom struggle&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is an intervention.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS is pretty simple. Classes, IDs, elements and pseudo-elements, with style
definitions attached to each. Calling it a &amp;ldquo;language&amp;rdquo; is a bit of a stretch
(though preprocessors like &lt;a href=&#34;https://sass-lang.com&#34;&gt;Sass&lt;/a&gt; fit the bill).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, for years our stylesheets cascaded right on out to
infinity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge files with table-of-contents comments to try to make some sense of it &amp;ndash;
until a quick fix got pasted down at the bottom. Brittle style definitions
relying on tight coupling with HTML structure. Pieces of styles being replicated
here and there for different components with similar features, without any way
to tell they were related in the CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stylesheets were like that too, because strategies for writing CSS had barely
altered since the days when it was used to change the colors of the scroll bars
in Internet Explorer. Luckily, in the past couple of years both
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-extends-placeholders&#34;&gt;CSS architecture and CSS preprocessors came into their own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;SMACSS&lt;/strong&gt;, or
&lt;a href=&#34;http://smacss.com/&#34;&gt;Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS&lt;/a&gt;, was developed
by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://snook.ca/&#34;&gt;Jonathan Snook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a featured speaker at Drupalcon
Portland. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to get the opportunity to have Jonathan speak, not
only because of my personally well-dog-eared copy of &lt;em&gt;SMACSS&lt;/em&gt;, but because
Drupal itself is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2013/05/world-class-frontend-track-drupalcon-portland&#34;&gt;adopting a SMACSS approach&lt;/a&gt;
to its CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke with Jonathan about sustainable stylesheets and the future of SMACSS.
For an even more detailed look,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/session/scalable-and-modular-architecture-css.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;please join me at Jonathan Snook&amp;rsquo;s featured Drupalcon Portland this afternon, Tuesday, May 21 at 4:30 PM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: What&amp;rsquo;s the biggest mistake you see people making when writing CSS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JS: I think the biggest mistake is thinking of everything in the context of a
single page. We&amp;rsquo;re no longer just building sites with a design for a home page
and an inside page. We&amp;rsquo;re developing complex systems that need to work in a
variety of contexts and we need a development approach that complements that.&lt;/p&gt;

        title=&#34; &#34;
      
    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: What&amp;rsquo;s
the biggest &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; you see in using the SMACSS approach? Why should frontend
developers change their approach to CSS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JS: The biggest win is maintainability. The SMACSS methodology makes it easier
to build larger projects by breaking things down into smaller components. Like
the move from spaghetti code to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller&#34;&gt;MVC&lt;/a&gt;
frameworks on the server side, this separation of concerns on the CSS side
improves the process of putting a site or web app together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: In the last part of your book, you talk about how the SMACSS approach fits
in to work using a preprocessor like Sass. There have been a lot of developments
in Sass in the past year &amp;ndash; have they had any positive effects on your use of
the SMACSS approach?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JS: With Sass, the introduction of placeholders was a positive step forward.
Overall, Sass (and other preprocessors) are a great way to augment &amp;ndash; but not
replace &amp;ndash; the way people write CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: What are your thoughts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.bem.info/&#34;&gt;BEM&lt;/a&gt;? Do you see it as
compatible with SMACSS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JS: I see BEM as very compatible. BEM really enforces naming convention, which
is a very important concept in SMACSS. They both take a modular approach to site
development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: What are you tacking next when it comes to CSS and frontend development?
Will there be a &amp;ldquo;SMACSS Part Two&amp;rdquo;? Or something else entirely?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JS: I&amp;rsquo;d love to augment SMACSS with case studies and expand on some of the ideas
in the book based on things that come up in the workshops I do. I&amp;rsquo;d also like to
work on a prototyping/site development tool that uses the SMACSS concepts. We
had built something like this when I was at Yahoo! that I think many people in
the industry would find really useful. Hopefully I can find the time to work on
it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/we-need-talk-about-your-stylesheets-interview-jonathan-snook-drupalcon-portland/&#34;&gt;We need to talk about your stylesheets: An interview with Jonathan Snook at Drupalcon Portland&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media queries&lt;/strong&gt; are a key part of responsive web design, because they control
at what width (among other things) different CSS rules kick in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://breakpoint-sass.com/&#34;&gt;Breakpoint&lt;/a&gt; makes writing media queries in Sass
super simple,&amp;rdquo; say &lt;strong&gt;Mason Wendell&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Sam Richard&lt;/strong&gt;, creators of the
extension to &lt;a href=&#34;http://compass-style.org/&#34;&gt;Compass&lt;/a&gt;, and they&amp;rsquo;re right. It&amp;rsquo;s not
surprising that we&amp;rsquo;d want them to present at Drupalcon, since design in Drupal,
like web design everywhere, has been embracing responsive web design as a
fundamental principle. (Side note: This website is in the midst of a responsive
web design overhaul. Cobbler&amp;rsquo;s children and all that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Mason and Sam about how Breakpoint makes responsive web design even
easier. Don&amp;rsquo;t miss
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/session/managing-responsive-web-design-sass-and-breakpoint.html&#34;&gt;their Drupalcon Portland frontend session, &amp;ldquo;Managing Responsive Web Design with Sass and Breakpoint,&amp;rdquo; on Thursday at 10:45 AM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: What motivated you to create Breakpoint? How has it changed your own
workflow?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MW: Before Sass 3.2 came out I had written an article for The Sass Way that
previewed some of it&amp;rsquo;s new features, including the ability to use variables in
media queries. I created an example that baked in some names for breakpoints
into a kind of &amp;ldquo;master mixin&amp;rdquo; for media queries. On my next responsive project I
put the theories I&amp;rsquo;d written for that post into practice, and found that I could
refine that approach. If I assigned a variable to each media query first the
approach would be very flexible. Then when noticed that I wrote min-width
queries way more often than any other type I set up defaults that made creating
media queries very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MW: There was a side effect that I think is more useful though. By assigning
names to each of my media queries I&amp;rsquo;m able to keep them in context in a much
more effective way. If I some media queries to deal with the width of a nav
element, and then later I add an item to that nav, I can change the value of
that variable and all the associated queries are adjusted. This is even more
effective when handing code back and forth within a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SR: Breakpoint was created with the motivation to ease many of the pain points
of working with media queries in CSS. The biggest pain point that Breakpoint
solves is providing meaningful semantics to your media queries. When building
content based responsive sites, early in your design process two unrelated items
may happen to break at the same points, but as your project grows, those points
may change and a simple find and replace will have unintended consequences. This
is probably the biggest workflow win to using Breakpoint, all of your media
queries now have proper semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SR: The other big win for my workflow is Breakpoint&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/at-import/breakpoint/wiki/No-Query-Fallbacks&#34;&gt;no-query fallback&lt;/a&gt;,
allowing me to very easily add in fallback code for any of the media queries I
write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: What can Breakpoint do that just assigning variable names to specific
min-widths can&amp;rsquo;t?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SR: For starters, Breakpoint handles much more than min-width queries. It is
designed to be future friendly and currently supports all CSS level 3 and level
4 media queries. Additionally, it&amp;rsquo;s syntax is easy to use to create complex
media queries, including both and and or media queries. It has native handling
for all of the different media query requirement for resolution (of which you
need to write at least four different queries for currently) while just writing
the standard. The no-query fallbacks are a huge win as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MW: The main benefit is that you can assign names and manage your media queries
with variables. This helps you avoid having them scattered around your SCSS, and
makes is easy to understand how they&amp;rsquo;re related and affect each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MW: While Breakpoint is optimized for min-width because they&amp;rsquo;re used most often
it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there. There are a number of shortcuts built in, for fencing
min- and max- values, converting pixels to ems, and even vendor prefixed queries
like resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MW: We even created a way to Breakpoint to report back to you what queries are
in a particular context.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/at-import/Singularity&#34;&gt;Singularity GS&lt;/a&gt; uses this feature to
kind of magically create responsive grid systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SR: Of all of Breakpoint&amp;rsquo;s features, probably the least used, but most powerful
is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/at-import/breakpoint/wiki/Breakpoint-Context&#34;&gt;Breakpoint Context&lt;/a&gt;.
This allows you to call a function anywhere and get the current media query
context allowing for amazingly intelligent mixins and functions to be written in
Sass, something unique to Breakpoint that you simply don&amp;rsquo;t have with
interpolating variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: Are there any responsive web design aspects specific to Drupal
theming/frontend development that Breakpoint helps with?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SR: There is nothing Drupal specific that Breakpoint helps with. Breakpoint,
like Sass, was built to be backend independent. This means that if you are
building any site, regardless of if it&amp;rsquo;s a Drupal site or a Node site or a
static site, Breakpoint is able to do its job handily without being caught up in
being tied to a specific backend technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MW: One of the things I love about working with Sass is that it&amp;rsquo;s not
Drupal-specific, and it&amp;rsquo;s meant to be used anywhere on the web. Breakpoint
follows that example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: Is Breakpoint a successor to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/snugug/respond-to&#34;&gt;Respond-To&lt;/a&gt;, or will that continue to get
developed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SR: In a way, yes and no. Respond-To was written before Breakpoint, but upon
Breakpoint&amp;rsquo;s release, it was decided that our efforts should be focused on a
unified Media Query engine, with Respond-To as a wrapper syntax for Breakpoint.
This is how the current Respond-To project exists. As of Breakpoint 2.0, the
Respond-To mixin has been incorporated into Breakpoint core, so you now can use
Respond-To without needing an additional Compass extension!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: Do you use
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/breakpoints&#34;&gt;Breakpoints module&lt;/a&gt; (in Drupal 8
core)? Or do you just do all of that through Sass?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SR: I personally truly dislike the Breakpoint module. Every use case I&amp;rsquo;ve heard
for it seems to be based on the thinking that sites have three or four
breakpoints and that everything can be boiled down into an easy to use admin
interface. There are no standard breakpoints, period, and good, reasonably
complex responsive sites will usually have 20 or more breakpoints. Responsive
cannot be done from the backend, and the Breakpoint module encourages you to do
so (as does the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/spark&#34;&gt;Spark layout initiative&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: Do you think any aspects of Breakpoint might get rolled directly into Sass
in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MW: It&amp;rsquo;s possible, but we probably won&amp;rsquo;t move the obvious parts to the Sass
language. There are some helper functions that we&amp;rsquo;ve written in Ruby that would
be very useful in Sass core. Once that&amp;rsquo;s in we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to offer Breakpoint
without Compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SR: I do not believe Breakpoint will be rolled directly into Sass, nor would I
want it to be, as it is out of scope of Sass core. As much as I like them, I
even think the color functions in Sass are out of scope for it. Sass core should
simply be the language and the bare minimum function base for it to be useable.
Sass doesn&amp;rsquo;t ship with any mixins, and I think it should probably stay that way.
That being said, Breakpoint is fairly stable; our 1.3 release stood stable for
six or so months without needing any changes until we rewrote the whole thing
for our 2.x release, so maybe being merged into Compass isn&amp;rsquo;t out of the
question, but I do not see a need for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: I hear in addition to Breakpoint, Sam went and created some kind of magic
box of Sass called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/at-import/toolkit&#34;&gt;Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;. Want to say
more about that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SR: Toolkit started life as RWD Kickstart, a project Mason and I kind of made up
on the spot a year ago at one of the first New York Sass meetups. Its original
goal was simply to be a collection of Compass templates to make pulling in media
query and grid solutions together easily. Since then, it&amp;rsquo;s evolved to be more of
a collection of Progressive Enhancement, Design in Browser, and Modern Web
Development tools, a toolkit if you&amp;rsquo;ll let me, of useful tools. I&amp;rsquo;d say the four
biggest thing that Toolkit has are a modern Clearfix mixin, progressive
enhancement replace text mixins, a triangle generation mixin, and an intrinsic
ratio mixin to make using intrinsic ratios super easy. It also adds
&lt;code&gt;*, *:before, *:after { box-sizing: border-box}&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;img, video { max-width: 100%; height: auto; }&lt;/code&gt; to your stylesheets, which are
the first two things I do for any responsive project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SR: Toolkit&amp;rsquo;s templates have also evolved, Where originally there were five some
odd different templates to choose from, now there are just two, a basic one to
set up a basic partial structure, and a responsive web design one that pulls in
Breakpoint 2.x for media queries and Singularity 1.x for grids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: You &lt;a href=&#34;http://breakpoint-sass.com/&#34;&gt;sure know&lt;/a&gt; those late twentieth-century
presidents.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MW: With a name like Breakpoint, how could I not revisit the cinema classic
Point Break. Bodhi and his gang of thrill-seeking bank-robbing surfers evaded
the FBI for years until the newly minted Special Agent Johnny Utah was on the
case. I think we can all agree that there&amp;rsquo;s a poignant metaphor for web designer
there. And some pretty sweet GIFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupalcon-portland-responsive-web-design-snap-breakpoint-sass/&#34;&gt;Drupalcon Portland: Responsive web design in a snap with Breakpoint and Sass&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <link rel="enclosure" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-power-twig-drupalcon-portland-featured-session/twig_flickr-cgc.jpg" type="image/jpg" title="Drupal 8 and the power of Twig: A Drupalcon Portland featured session" />
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A new theming engine, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twig.symfony.com/&#34;&gt;Twig&lt;/a&gt;, is coming along with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/tags/drupal&#34;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; 8&amp;rsquo;s adoption of the Symfony framework. And it&amp;rsquo;s downright
magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of having theme functions that have to be overridden, everything becomes
an (easy to read, easy to modify) template. Instead of having to figure out
render arrays, themers can use consistent template variables. And instead of
having insecure output, Twig sanitizes everything by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/tags/wordpress&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; or Tumblr theme, the
approach will feel pretty similar. Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;

    
      
        
        &lt;source srcset=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-power-twig-drupalcon-portland-featured-session/twig-sample.avif %!s(&lt;nil&gt;)&#34; type=&#34;image/avif&#34;&gt;
        
        &lt;source srcset=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-power-twig-drupalcon-portland-featured-session/twig-sample.webp %!s(&lt;nil&gt;)&#34; type=&#34;image/webp&#34;&gt;
        
        
    &lt;img
      loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
      decoding=&#34;async&#34;
      alt=&#34;Example of Twig template in Drupal&#34;
      
        class=&#34;image_figure image_internal image_processed&#34;
        width=&#34;675&#34;
        height=&#34;375&#34;

    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And oh by the way, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twig.symfony.com/doc/&#34;&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s well-documented&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; no
small point in the Drupal community!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound too good to be true?&lt;/strong&gt; Well, it almost might be, because
&lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.drupal.org/node/298298&#34;&gt;a lot has to happen in order to get this into Drupal 8&lt;/a&gt;.
There&amp;rsquo;s a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/sprints.html&#34;&gt;Twig-focused sprint happening right after Drupalcon&lt;/a&gt;,
so if you think this is great, come pitch in! Because if things don&amp;rsquo;t get done,
Twig will be held until Drupal 9. No Drupal themer, veteran or newbie, kitten or
human, wants that to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to &lt;strong&gt;Jen Lampton&lt;/strong&gt; (with a contribution from &lt;strong&gt;Fabian Franz&lt;/strong&gt;) about how
Twig will result in happier veteran Drupal themers, happier new Drupal themers,
and happier Drupal kittens. Be sure to show up for their
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/session/using-twig-new-template-engine-drupal-8.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;featured Drupalcon session (along with Drupal CSS innovator John Albin Wilkins), &amp;ldquo;Using Twig: The new template engine in Drupal 8,&amp;rdquo; on Wednesday at 3:45 PM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: What&amp;rsquo;s one thing you&amp;rsquo;re most excited about with Twig?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JL: Replacing the template engine with something completely different means that
we get to take a good hard look at absolutely everything in the current theme
system, so we can do a clean sweep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FF: What I love the most about Twig is the syntax, and how it cleverly makes it
possible to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/node/1982024&#34;&gt;lazy-render things&lt;/a&gt;. The
possibilities of having an interpreted language are endless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: Can theme developers start converting/creating their themes now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JL: No! If you have the time to start converting your own themes, then please,
please, please use the time to help us make the theme system what you want it to
be &amp;ndash; instead. There will be time to convert your themes later, but Drupal
itself can only be monumentally improved &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: Will frontend developers and themers coming from other CMSes &amp;ndash; like
WordPress &amp;ndash; find Twig easier to use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JL: Yes. Front end developers coming from everywhere will find Twig easier to
use. For starters, Twig looks a lot more like HTML, so if you don&amp;rsquo;t know PHP
you&amp;rsquo;ll still be right at home. For people who do know PHP and don&amp;rsquo;t know Twig,
there will be a learning curve, but it&amp;rsquo;s far far FAR less steep than learning
about what Drupal had done to PHPTemplate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: Twig sounds great! What can people do to help make sure it happens for
Drupal 8?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JL: There are four main areas where we need help right now, as outlined in our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.drupal.org/node/278968&#34;&gt;Twig TODO wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help us test all the patches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help us fix issues with the patches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help us improve the markup in core (after being converted to Twig).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help us clean up the rest of the theme system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people are interested in any one of these four areas, they can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/sprints.html&#34;&gt;come to the sprint immediately following DrupalCon&lt;/a&gt;
and get some hands-on help making Drupal better. We need all the hands we can
get since we are up against some major deadlines, so please please please come
help us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-power-twig-drupalcon-portland-featured-session/&#34;&gt;Drupal 8 and the power of Twig: A Drupalcon Portland featured session&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

operator and getting a live human to look up the number of a business or place a
collect call. We have the digital means to complete lots of tasks like that

and &lt;strong&gt;Wim Leers&lt;/strong&gt; in their

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re both part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/spark&#34;&gt;Spark team&lt;/a&gt;, an
initiative to improve the authoring experience in Drupal for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spark is more well known for things like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/quickedit&#34;&gt;in-place editing&lt;/a&gt; and a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/navbar&#34;&gt;mobile friendly toolbar&lt;/a&gt;, (see image).
But from the beginning, improving the experience for everyone has been a big
priority, and one of the most exciting developments is a new aural interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right, Drupal is getting a switchboard operator:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so that doesn&amp;rsquo;t look &lt;em&gt;terribly&lt;/em&gt; exciting all on its own. But trust me, when
you watch the videos of people interacting with Drupal 8 and having menus and
selections read as they go, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I spoke with J. Ren&amp;eacute;e about Drupal 8 and the nature of working on
accessibility, the passion for this work really shown through. I&amp;rsquo;m really
looking forward to their session with Wim,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/node/2158.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Drupal Speaks: Aural user interfaces, new Drupal 8 accessibility features,&amp;rdquo; on Wednesday at 10:45 AM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: What are we missing when we talk about accessibility right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JRB: I want developers to understand that accessibility is fundamental to user
interface development. We tend to talk about accessibility like we talk about
gender. Both have coded values. When we speak of being gendered, we are often
talking about being non-male. Male is a kind of genderless base state. So is it
with accessibility. When we speak of making something accessible, we tend to
refer to making an interface for blind users or for users with physical
capabilities that make keyboard and mouse use difficult, as examples. Visual is
a kind of accessible base state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We risk &amp;ldquo;othering&amp;rdquo; folks for whom accessibility is an issue because as
developers, in general, non-visual accessibility has not been a primary concern.
I know what is is like to be othered. In some ways, highlighting otherness can
be an effective way to bring focus to a problem. Eventually though, we need to
resolve those issues and close the loop on the otherness. We can be other and
also be equal. Now is the time for front end developers to start thinking about
accessibility as a multi-modal effort. We no longer have the excuse that the
tools and technologies available to us do not support efficient workflows for
non-visual UI development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: Where is Drupal 8 going to do better?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JRB: Most importantly, we have more individual core contributors this cycle who
truly believe in addressing accessibility issues. And they are all smart,
wonderful people which makes working with them a pleasure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, take
&lt;a href=&#34;https://drupal.org/node/1811128&#34;&gt;this issue about requirement warnings during installation&lt;/a&gt;.
For a sighted user, a warning during installation is immediately apparent. The
missing requirement is made distinct with color contrast. For a blind user, they
must traverse every cell in the table to discover a missing requirement. Would
we ever impose such a burden on a sight user through the UI? No, not without
grumbles in the issue queues at least. With more contributors invested in
improving these types of non-visual details, we are polishing all the rough
edges &amp;ndash; the ones we see &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the ones we don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: How important is context in aural interfaces?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JRB: Context is important to all interfaces. As front end developers we build
templates that expose context in a predictable, consumable way. As a practice we
have established and then refined patterns of visual expression over the past
30-plus years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaphors grounded visual pointer displays on a virtual desktop. We talk of
visual affordances in rounded, gradient-embellished, reflective buttons.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph&#34;&gt;Skeumorphic designs&lt;/a&gt; bring our
understanding of the physical world to bear on pixels and bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are the metaphors in aural interface design? I know of none. To me, these
interfaces are flat. The metal is bare underneath them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps non-visual interfaces have one less level of abstraction to traverse.
Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s no need to translate language into symbol and then back into
language. But that little bit of designer in me, that memory of a linguist I
almost was, remembers being thunderstruck with insight reading
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Jackendoff&#34;&gt;Jackendoff&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; unfurling of
metaphor after I had just so recently fallen smitten with the strict generative
grammar of early
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky#Linguistic_theory&#34;&gt;Chomsky&lt;/a&gt;.
Jackendoff gives us a way of understanding language that starts at basic
physical dichotomies &amp;ndash; up/down and near/far &amp;ndash; and from there offers us a model
of communication. He gives us pattern. (Early) Chomsky gave us metal. So much
that we humans do starts with structure that softens with time to fit our curvy,
winding nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to believe that the aural interfaces we have today still just the awkward
first attempts to build an abstract audio interface pattern language. That
non-visual interface design is still working through its
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_linguistics&#34;&gt;structuralist&lt;/a&gt; phase. We
are still learning how to pack context into denser forms through non-visual
expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: Will the Drupal 8 improvements have things to offer module developers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JRB: In Drupal 8, we are building tools that manage a couple of the trickier
components of accessibility in a browser. These are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outputting audio updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing tabbing in constrained workflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Module developers will be able to pass a string to a method called
&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;announce&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; on the Drupal object and have that string read by a screen
reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another method on the Drupal object called &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;tabbingManager&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; will constrain
tabbable elements on the page. A developer will select those elements, either
through JavaScript methods or jQuery, and pass them to the tabbingManager.
Tabbing is then constrained to those elements until the constraint is superseded
or released. I know that must not be completely clear, but that&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re
presenting
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/node/2158.html&#34;&gt;a session about aural user interfaces and how we can use these new tools to build them&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-aural-interfaces-groundbreaking-accessibility-drupalcon-portland/&#34;&gt;Drupal 8, aural interfaces and groundbreaking accessibility at Drupalcon Portland&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ah, base themes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;rsquo;s an analogue to the Windows/Mac/Linux battle in Drupal land, it&amp;rsquo;s
probably &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/zen&#34;&gt;Zen&lt;/a&gt; vs.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/omega&#34;&gt;Omega&lt;/a&gt; vs.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/adaptivetheme&#34;&gt;AdaptiveTheme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garrett Dawson&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;John Ferris&lt;/strong&gt; have a way out of that eternal struggle:
Custom base themes. As they put it in their
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/node/3043.html&#34;&gt;Drupalcon Portland session description&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By necessity, base themes make assumptions about how teams and individuals
work. By rolling your own, you&amp;rsquo;ll become much more comfortable and informed
about the Drupal theming layer, and have a better launchpad for your front-end
projects.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in Portland we take home gardening and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture&#34;&gt;permaculture&lt;/a&gt; seriously, so what
better place to talk about &amp;ldquo;growing your own&amp;rdquo; custom base theme!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke with John and Garrett about how creating your own base theme can make
work for you and your team easier.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/node/3043.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a gander at their session, &amp;ldquo;Dapper Drupal: Custom Tailored Themes,&amp;rdquo; on Thursday at 2:15 PM for the full story!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: Base themes that are out there make some assumptions about how you want to
theme. What&amp;rsquo;s the advantage to rolling your own base theme rather than finding
the theme that already makes the assumptions you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JF and GD: If you can find a base theme in contrib that fits perfectly into your
workflow, by all means, use it. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of solid tools out there. We don&amp;rsquo;t
want to deter people from using and contributing to them. With that said, we
feel it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely a contributed base theme will be ticking all the boxes and
making all the right assumptions about your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all approach. Your front-end process is heavily
influenced by team dynamics, contrib module choices and a whole host of other
considerations. The majority of base themes cannot account for those variables
like you can. We want front-end developers to take a critical look at their
tools to see where they can make improvements. That may mean creating a custom
base theme; a custom starter theme for use with an existing base theme; or even
a set of helper modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the popular base themes started because someone wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy with what was
available at the time. The ultimate goal is increasing efficiency while
improving the quality of the final HTML, CSS and JS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: Do you recommend custom base themes for big shops? Small distributed
teams? Freelancers? Everyone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JF/GD: Yes, all of the above. At least consider it as an option. If you find
yourself doing any kind of repetitive work, there&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity for
improvement. The only people who should steer clear of custom base themes are
those new to Drupal. You need to be familiar with the tools that are available
before setting out to create your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: Besides your the custom base themes you developed yourselves
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/center&#34;&gt;Center&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/prototype&#34;&gt;Prototype&lt;/a&gt;) what other custom base
themes have you seen in the wild?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JF/GD: Yes! We&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot working with and iterating on Center and
Prototype. They work well for the structure of our team and the type of work we
do at &lt;a href=&#34;https://atendesigngroup.com/&#34;&gt;Aten&lt;/a&gt;. However, we realize every team is
unique. We were really interested in seeing how other organizations were
approaching the front-end problem space. We chatted with a range of teams of
varying sizes working across different industries. Everyone has their own unique
set of tools based on their own strengths and constraints. We&amp;rsquo;re excited to
share those with you, but you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to come and see for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/grow-your-own-learning-custom-base-themes-drupalcon-portland/&#34;&gt;Grow your own: Learning custom base themes at Drupalcon Portland&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        title=&#34; &#34;
      
    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that in the last year, adopting the CSS preprocessor
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sass-lang.com/&#34;&gt;Sass&lt;/a&gt; has completely changed frontend development for
me. That&amp;rsquo;s a sentiment I&amp;rsquo;ve heard others express when they started using it &amp;ndash;
and I was pretty late to the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got attracted to it initially through variables. We&amp;rsquo;ve all been there when a
client or a designer wants to change a color and suddenly we have to change
dozens or hundreds of values across CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20150919092337/http://www.dalesande.com/&#34;&gt;Dale Sande&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
captures that kind of revolution in efficiency that Sass brings, as seen in a
screenshot from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/node/333.html&#34;&gt;his upcoming presentation at Drupalcon Portland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Dale, who&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/anotheruiguy&#34;&gt;spoken plenty on Sass&lt;/a&gt;
and organizes the
&lt;a
  data-dead-link=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/SASSlang/&#34;
  href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/dead-link/&#34;
  title=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/SASSlang/ [dead link]&#34;
  &gt;Seattle Sass meetup&lt;/a
&gt;, is
taking us way past the Sass basics like variables, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m excited to
see his presentation next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time Sass came onto the scene, some thoughtful people were
exploring more maintainable frontend development and CSS architecture through
ideas/acronyms like &lt;strong&gt;OOCSS&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;SMACSS&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;BEM&lt;/strong&gt;, and folks like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki&#34;&gt;Nicole Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://smacss.com/&#34;&gt;Jonathan Snook&lt;/a&gt; (a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2013/05/world-class-frontend-track-drupalcon-portland&#34;&gt;Drupalcon featured speaker!&lt;/a&gt;),
&lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/&#34;&gt;Nicolas Gallagher&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cssguidelin.es/&#34;&gt;Harry Roberts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke with Dale about Sass, object-oriented CSS and some the things he&amp;rsquo;ll be
covering at Drupalcon.
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/node/333.html&#34;&gt;Be sure to join me at his session, &amp;ldquo;Sass: OO&amp;rsquo;S&amp;rsquo;CSS w/Extends and Silent Placeholders,&amp;rdquo; on Wednesday at 2:15 PM!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: Some people argue SASS creates bloated code &amp;ndash; do you see placeholders
addressing that concern effectively?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DS: Sass doesn&amp;rsquo;t create bad code.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://thesassway.com/sass-doesnt-create-bad-code-bad-coders-do/&#34;&gt;Bad coders do.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole concept of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://chriseppstein.github.io/blog/2012/08/23/sass-3-2-is-released/&#34;&gt;placeholder selectors&lt;/a&gt;
was designed to fight code bloat and be a more pragmatic solution to OOCSS. In
my presentation, I illustrate how using the various techniques generate code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real &amp;ldquo;ah-ha&amp;rdquo; moment comes when we see how using placeholder selectors makes
it easier to manage and literally re-use code &amp;ndash; thus reducing dreaded CSS
bloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IB: What&amp;rsquo;s the advantage to using silent placeholders over mixins for a set of
rules?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DS: Simply put, being able to re-use code without duplicating code. The use of
mixins was the first part of being
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself&#34;&gt;DRY with our code&lt;/a&gt;.
Looking at the Sass it felt AWESOME! But when we looked at the output CSS, this
is when we realized that we were all living a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our CSS rules were being duplicated tens, if not hundreds of times. We weren&amp;rsquo;t
being DRY, we simply put the onus of duplication on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Placeholder selectors embrace the one of the oldest concepts of CSS and that is
to extend the CSS selector for reuse. But with traditional CSS this was
difficult to do, especially when you were dealing with thousands of lines of
code. Sass&amp;rsquo; @extend directive allows developers to create name-spaced reusable
chunks of code that is portable, re-usable and extendable without duplicating
anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;

    &lt;img
      loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
      decoding=&#34;async&#34;
      alt=&#34;Fighting tight coupling in CSS by keeping code separation in Sass ::align-right&#34;
      
        class=&#34;image_figure image_internal image_processed&#34;
        width=&#34;350&#34;
        height=&#34;258&#34;

    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;IB:
Do you see placeholders as helping to reduce the amount of tight
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programming%29&#34;&gt;coupling&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash;
scattering pieces of styles in multiple places?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DS: While placeholder selectors are a tool that can help with scattered code, it
is not the only solution. Having a file/folder structure that embraces the
different types of code, e.g. CSS selectors, placeholder selectors, mixins and
functions, can assist in creating reusable modulare code and maintain a process
of control over the many parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-extends-placeholders/&#34;&gt;Ninjas in your code at Drupalcon Portland: Sass with extends and placeholders&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The big news at Drupalcon Portland is that, for the first time at a Drupalcon,
we&amp;rsquo;re having separate
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/tracks/#frontend&#34;&gt;frontend&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/tracks/#UX&#34;&gt;user experience (UX)&lt;/a&gt;
tracks. That means we were able to offer even more sessions targeted directly at
frontend developers, and as the local track chair for frontend, I&amp;rsquo;m really
excited about what we&amp;rsquo;ve ended up with!&lt;/p&gt;

First and foremost, of
course, we have &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Snook&lt;/strong&gt; presenting on his concept (and book)
&lt;a href=&#34;http://smacss.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
SMACSS has
had a big impact on a lot of frontend developers and themers &amp;ndash; and in fact it&amp;rsquo;s
had a huge impact on Drupal itself. The
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/zen&#34;&gt;Zen base theme&lt;/a&gt;, the most-downloaded Drupal
theme out there, has
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/node/1931746&#34;&gt;adopted a SMACSS approach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Drupal itself is moving toward SMACSS with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/node/1921610#comment-7096746&#34;&gt;a re-organization of its CSS&lt;/a&gt;
in the upcoming Drupal 8 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/session/scalable-and-modular-architecture-css.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join Jonathan Snook at Drupalcon Portland on Tuesday, May 21 at 4:30 PM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;drupal-8-and-twig&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Drupal 8 and Twig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, so there&amp;rsquo;s this new version of Drupal coming out pretty soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.drupal.org/drupal-initiatives&#34;&gt;many, many awesome things happening with Drupal 8&lt;/a&gt;,
one of the most relevant to frontend developers is the adoption (with a little
luck) of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twig.symfony.com/&#34;&gt;Twig templating engine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twig, a component of Symfony &amp;ndash; a framework
&lt;a href=&#34;https://symfony.com/blog/symfony2-meets-drupal-8&#34;&gt;being adopted by Drupal 8&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash;
will enable themers to write much cleaner (and safer!) code, and enable module
developers to simplify the theming components of their modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No joke, at the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20150822122025/http://2012.badcamp.net:80/program/sessions/new-theme-layer-drupal-8&#34;&gt;BADCamp 2012 Twig session&lt;/a&gt;,
there were literally gasps in the audience as we all saw how cool it was. If
you&amp;rsquo;re a themer or a frontend developer, don&amp;rsquo;t miss this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/session/using-twig-new-template-engine-drupal-8.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join Jen Lampton, Fabian Franz and John Albin Wilkins presenting Twig on Wednesday, May 22 at 3:45 PM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;and-so-much-more&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And so much more!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just touched on two of the featured sessions at Drupalcon Portland. In the
coming week I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting more about some of the other sessions, but you can

and start planning to attend your favorites! (Don&amp;rsquo;t forget
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/sessions.html&#34;&gt;the User Experience sessions too&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dan Pallotta, who presented the TED talk,
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong&#34;&gt;The way we think about charity is dead wrong&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo;
spoke at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nten.org/ntc/&#34;&gt;Nonprofit Technology Conference&lt;/a&gt; this
morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His arguments, which are not particularly new, are that nonprofits are under
restraints &amp;ndash; some culturally, and some self-imposed &amp;ndash; that limit their
potential. If only charities were run more like businesses, he says &amp;ndash; with high
executive pay and less belief in large &amp;ldquo;overhead&amp;rdquo; being a stand-in for
inefficiency &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;d be able to do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan follows in the long tradition of successful businessmen (it&amp;rsquo;s almost
always men) arriving on the nonprofit scene talking loudly and listening
rarely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His ideas are wrong almost by design, because Dan isn&amp;rsquo;t interested in making
nonprofits more powerful; he&amp;rsquo;s interested in making society more receptive to
unrestrained business &amp;ndash; nonprofits, in this case, are merely a proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;He is not a credible defender of nonprofits&lt;/strong&gt; because he doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to
really care for them. He appears not to grasp the notion that markets
fail&amp;ndash;and that one of nonprofits&amp;rsquo; primary roles is to address those failures,
not mimic corporations. He has consistently disparaged nonprofits. In a
&lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt; blog, he wrote that he&amp;rsquo;d be hard pressed to think of
any business that wasn&amp;rsquo;t making more of a positive difference in society than
nonprofits.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philanthropy.com/article/nonprofits-need-a-stronger-voice-but-not-from-the-wrong-messenger/&#34;&gt;Phil Buchanan&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;The Chronicle of Philanthropy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Just as he makes a fetish out of unrestrained capitalism&lt;/strong&gt;, he makes a
fetish out of cash over other means of securing happiness and satisfaction at
work. How insulting to think that, if we make less pay than our for profit
counterparts, we must be less creative, talented, intelligent and less capable
of helping others.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20150911224753/http://www.kenscommentary.org/2011/02/uncharitable-webinar-2-1-11.html&#34;&gt;Ken Berger&lt;/a&gt;,
Charity Navigator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The entire approach is based on the scarcity-model, zero-sum game that people
like to play with charities.&lt;/strong&gt; In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve referred to this as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2010/12/google-chrome-cause-or-nonprofit-deathmatch-strikes-again&#34;&gt;nonprofit deathmatch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet lots of research has shown people who donate once are
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20150911224753/http://www.articlesbase.com/non-profit-organizations-articles/the-16-principles-of-personal-fundraising-influence-5204143.html&#34;&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt;
to &lt;a

  title=&#34;https://twitter.com/MollyZerener/status/121363610214739968 [dead link]&#34;
  &gt;again&lt;/a
&gt;,
even to other organizations in the same field &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s why some nonprofits sell
their lists. And the same principle is at work with advocacy:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://joymayer.com/2010/10/01/the-nonprofit-worlds-ladder-of-engagement/&#34;&gt;get people interested&lt;/a&gt;
and they&amp;rsquo;ll &lt;a href=&#34;https://bethkanter.org/tweet-huggers/&#34;&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nonprofitmarketingguide.com/chucking-the-ladder-of-engagement/&#34;&gt;taking&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://groundwire.org/blog/groundwire-engagement-pyramid/&#34;&gt;action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting away from the scarcity model allows organizations to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20130812124615/http://e.myntc.zerista.com/event/member/65121&#34;&gt;build movements&lt;/a&gt;
instead of just lists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not suprising that his views are so limited when he consistently groups all
organizations into &amp;ldquo;nonprofits&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;charities&amp;rdquo; without recognizing the huge
differences among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service organizations have very different goals from advocacy-based
organizations, to say nothing of institutional nonprofits like universities,
hospitals and museums. But they&amp;rsquo;re all just the &amp;ldquo;nonprofit sector&amp;rdquo; to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;To Mr. Pallotta, it&amp;rsquo;s the total amount of funds raised that is the ultimate
measure.&lt;/strong&gt; His defense of CEO pay justifies compensation in the context of
revenue, apparently assuming that a charity that has more money will
inevitably get better results.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Myth #1: There are $400,000 talents.&lt;/strong&gt; The first falsehood is that there
are people who are just worth more. Defending wide
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/growingunequalincomedistributionandpovertyinoecdcountries.htm&#34;&gt;inequality&lt;/a&gt;
relies upon the notion that some people are worth much more, based on
training, ability, or certain special qualities. This notion makes inequality
appear legitimate to people at all levels, and thereby harder to redress. The
use of the phrase &amp;rsquo;low-wage worker,&amp;rsquo; instead of &amp;lsquo;worker who is paid a low
wage,&amp;rsquo; hints at a peculiarly American sleight of hand: Someone&amp;rsquo;s place in the
wage structure is an indicator of their true merit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan also has little use for any vision of social change, or any apparent
understanding of social movements&lt;/strong&gt;, since none that could be called successful
have in any way fit his vision. Because Dan&amp;rsquo;s vision isn&amp;rsquo;t one of social change,
it&amp;rsquo;s one of a perpetuation of wealth, with nonprofits simply one more business
sector in which to advertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.@&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/danpalotta&#34;&gt;danpalotta&lt;/a&gt; The ? I have is, &lt;strong&gt;why should
NPOs be more like biz&lt;/strong&gt;? Isn&amp;rsquo;t what&amp;rsquo;s necessary to change the game, not make
more of the same? &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%252313NTC&amp;f=live&#34;&gt;#13NTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He makes more references to Steve Jobs, Apple, and its products&amp;ndash;the index
lists seven, though I counted more&amp;ndash;in Charity Case than to any nonprofit
organization. Yet he says &lt;strong&gt;he is rising to the defense of nonprofits:
comparing the &amp;lsquo;movement&amp;rsquo; he seeks to lead to the civil-rights movement&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capitalism isn&amp;rsquo;t the solution. It&amp;rsquo;s the problem, and many of us are fighting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capitalism created inequalities&lt;/strong&gt;, but we won&amp;rsquo;t let NPOs use capitalist
tools to address them&amp;ndash;missing a logical step?

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;[A] theme in the book is Dan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;idealization of capitalism almost as a God&lt;/strong&gt;
that can lead to self fulfillment and &amp;lsquo;stunning change&amp;rsquo; through the wonderful
motive of personal gain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%252313NTC&amp;f=live&#34;&gt;#13NTC&lt;/a&gt; Lots to agree with in
Dan Palotta&amp;rsquo;s plenary, but &lt;strong&gt;as an anti-capitalist I want to destroy the
system&lt;/strong&gt;, not compete w/it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;He co-opts our national conversation about income inequality to advance his
goals and the goals of a socio-economic elite that is content to believe in
meritocracy and their own meritoriousness.&lt;/strong&gt; We argue that it is misguided to
base the pay of executives in inequality-alleviating nonprofits on ideological
myths that have done much to reproduce and legitimate inequality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder Dan is so popular among the TED crowd &amp;ndash; business leaders and
wealthy technologists who can see a product in every social trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s more mystifying is why Dan Pallotta would be popular among nonprofits,
activists, and social changemakers. It&amp;rsquo;s clear Dan has no substantive message
for them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/04/uncharitable-how-businesses-co-opt-nonprofits-undermine-their-potential/&#34;&gt;Uncharitable: How businesses co-opt nonprofits and undermine their potential&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow at 1PM Eastern/10AM Pacific,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://devcollaborative.com/about-us&#34;&gt;Johanna Bates&lt;/a&gt; and I will be co-hosting
the monthly Nonprofit Drupal Community of Practice discussion and Q&amp;A call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a free conference call, sponsored by the Nonprofit Technology Network
(NTEN) but open to anyone.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.drupal.org/node/283848&#34;&gt;Please join us!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-will-we-talk-about&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What will we talk about?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a time to chat informally with other nonprofit-tech Drupalists &amp;ndash; an
open Q&amp;A discussion for anyone with or in nonprofits or social change groups
using Drupal. But generally speaking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuck on something? Have a question? Drupal experts will be on hand to answer
questions. (No question is too basic. Really.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psyched about a module or a Drupal event? Come tell us about it on the call!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s happening with Drupal 8? Some of us know stuff. Join us, let&amp;rsquo;s chat
about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, July 12, 2022:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an old post, but Domain Registry of America
is still around. It now goes by the name
&lt;a href=&#34;https://droa.com/&#34;&gt;Domain Registry Services&lt;/a&gt;, the better to be globally
misleading, I guess. It still has its old domain name, &lt;code&gt;droa.com&lt;/code&gt;. I have no
reason to think the facts contained in the original post below aren&amp;rsquo;t still
true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know how registering a website domain goes in a small nonprofit: A volunteer
or an intern or a staff person&amp;rsquo;s nephew set up the website years ago and
registered the domain somewhere &amp;ndash; which perhaps you only found out when it
suddenly expired, the email address renewal messages were being sent to having
long ago been deleted or moved. Remembering to renew your domain is probably
something you learned (perhaps the hard way) to schedule on your calendar, to
make sure the website doesn&amp;rsquo;t go down &amp;ndash; as it did once for me &amp;ndash; when the
single &amp;ldquo;tech person&amp;rdquo; on staff is away at a conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption_figure caption_internal&#34;&gt;Domain Registry of America &#34;notice&#34;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into this confusion steps &lt;a href=&#34;https://droa.com/&#34;&gt;Domain Registry of America&lt;/a&gt;, a
bottomfeeding company that intentionally misleads low-information website owners
into vastly overpaying for their domain registration by switching to their
&amp;ldquo;service.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t register your nonprofit website with Domain
Registry of America &amp;ndash; don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works: Domain Registry of America sends the owner of a website
domain an official-looking &amp;ldquo;expiration notice&amp;rdquo; (pictured at right), urging the
owner to &amp;ldquo;act today&amp;rdquo; to prevent &amp;ldquo;loss of your online identity making it
difficult for your customers and friends to locate you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does it get your mailing address? Domain Registry of America trawls &amp;ldquo;whois&amp;rdquo;
records, the official listings of contact information every website has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many domain registrars offer &amp;ldquo;whois privacy&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;whois anonymization,&amp;rdquo; enabling
registrants to substitute the registrar&amp;rsquo;s own contact information for yours. But
nonprofits, either because of a need for transparency or a lack of knowledge
about the service, often have their official mailing address listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domain Registry of America isn&amp;rsquo;t any kind of official or government-sanctioned
company (I&amp;rsquo;ve intentionally refrained from referring to it as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Domain
Registry of America), although that&amp;rsquo;s clearly the impression they&amp;rsquo;re aiming for
with their name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a harried nonprofit staffer gets a letter that says &amp;ldquo;domain name
expiration notice&amp;rdquo; in big letters at the top, they might well think back to the
last time their website unexpectedly expired and send back their &amp;ldquo;renewal&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;
not realizing they&amp;rsquo;ve unintentionally transferred their domain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to be fair, Domain Registry of America carefully words its documents to
specify that this &amp;ldquo;is not a bill&amp;rdquo; and that responding will &amp;ldquo;switch your domain
name registration.&amp;rdquo; But they&amp;rsquo;re clearly banking on people not reading closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain Registry of America &lt;em&gt;vastly&lt;/em&gt; overcharges for domain registrations &amp;ndash;
$35 per year with their &amp;ldquo;service,&amp;rdquo; whereas reputable registrars usually charge
between $10 and $15 per year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This company can&amp;rsquo;t compete on price or service; their entire business model is
built on swindling people into switching their registration. Because nonprofits
are more likely to be low-information customers in this space, and because
they&amp;rsquo;re likely to have their real contact information listed, nonprofits are at
particular risk of being exploited by Domain Registry of America. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen at
least two nonprofits nearly go through with the switch before they realized what
was happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t let it happen to your nonprofit. Just say no to Domain Registry of
America!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the local track chair for the frontend track, I&amp;rsquo;m posting this to encourage
any last-minute session proposals bouncing around in your head to get typed out
and proposed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/submit-session.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right: Today&amp;rsquo;s the Portland Drupalcon session proposal deadline. Submit your proposal now!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And yes, nonprofit and nonprofit developer friends,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/tracks/#NGO&#34;&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s an NGO track too&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the frontend track has been split off from the user experience track,
so you can be even more specific in your proposals. Here are the descriptions
for both tracks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;frontend-connecting-new-tools-and-techniques-to-create-an-effective-drupal-frontend-experiencehttpsportland2013drupalorgprogramtracksfrontend&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/tracks/#frontend&#34;&gt;Frontend: Connecting new tools and techniques to create an effective Drupal frontend experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frontend experience of a website is crucial to its success. Though the
backend of a site may be impeccable, the frontend experience gives the user
the first impression of an organization or company. Without a good frontend
experience, a site can turn users away. Let&amp;rsquo;s discover ways in which we can
connect our knowledge of different frontend tools and techniques with Drupal
&amp;ndash; and make Drupal a better experience for all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Themes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The importance of frontend development in creating websites &#43; web apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What frontend developers need to know to work well with backend devs, PMs,
UX, Content Strategists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preparing frontend devs for D8 and Twig&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend for mobile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using frontend frameworks such as Foundation and Bootstrap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speeding up the design process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend development for multilingual sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backend devs that do Frontend work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PMs that work with Frontend devs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;user-experience-uxhttpsportland2013drupalorgprogramtracksux&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/tracks/#UX&#34;&gt;User Experience (UX)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The User Experience process is key to the success of the development of
websites and web applications. From user research, interviews and analytics,
we learn what the user actually wants and needs; not what we assume they want.
At this year&amp;rsquo;s DrupalCon we present a new User Experience track to show our
community&amp;rsquo;s dedication to user needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Themes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explaining what user experience is and why it&amp;rsquo;s important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UX for mobile and tablet, Responsive UX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speeding up the design process using UX tools and techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UX for multilingual sites - especially RTL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content Strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UX professionals - Drupal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UX professionals outside of Drupal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backend devs that are interested in UX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend devs interested in UX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the frontend track, global track chair John Ferris and I are looking for
balance among three big areas: CSS and CSS metalanguages like Sass and LESS;
jQuery and JavaScript; and Drupal 8&amp;rsquo;s new template engine, Twig. There are also
topics that span those areas, such as frontend mobile development (including
responsiveness) and multilingual frontend development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/submit-session.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering whether you should submit a session proposal, as track chair let me clear it up for you: You should!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;awesome-frontend-speakers&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Awesome frontend speakers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drupalcon has some exciting keynote speakers, such as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/node/798.html&#34;&gt;Karen McGrane&lt;/a&gt;. But the frontend
track has some special guests we&amp;rsquo;re really looking forward to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Snook&lt;/strong&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS&lt;/em&gt;
(SMACSS), will be
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/session/scalable-and-modular-architecture-css.html&#34;&gt;presenting some of his ideas for writing great stylesheets&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;m personally very excited about this one!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jen Lampton&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Fabian Franz&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;John Albin Wilkins&lt;/strong&gt; will be doing
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/session/using-twig-new-template-engine-drupal-8.html&#34;&gt;an in-depth look at the aforementioned Twig&lt;/a&gt;,
Drupal 8&amp;rsquo;s new template engine. At a similar
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20150822122025/http://2012.badcamp.net:80/program/sessions/new-theme-layer-drupal-8&#34;&gt;presentation at BADCamp&lt;/a&gt;
last fall, I heard audible gasps from the audience. No joke, Twig is that
cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, be sure to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/register.html&#34;&gt;grab a ticket&lt;/a&gt; and get your
travel figured out to my (new) hometown of Portland for the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://portland2013.drupal.org/&#34;&gt;2013 North American Drupalcon&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/02/frontend-session-proposals-portland-drupalcon-due-today/&#34;&gt;Frontend session proposals to Portland Drupalcon due today!&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last month, the privacy commissioner for the German state Schleswig-Holstein,
Thilo Weichert, announced that he would
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dw.com/en/german-privacy-watchdog-declares-facebooks-like-button-illegal/a-15331909&#34;&gt;fine websites in his state &amp;euro;50,000 if they included Facebook&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Like&amp;rdquo; button&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weichert argues that this popular function breaches privacy by making it
possible for the social networking giant to guess user preferences and
opinions by compiling a profile of all the sites marked on one computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is that &lt;strong&gt;even if you don&amp;rsquo;t click the &amp;ldquo;Like&amp;rdquo; button, Facebook still
knows you visited the page&lt;/strong&gt; because its server gets called to display the
button code. For individuals already on Facebook, it can compile a detailed
profile of you around the web, based on what you visit (again, whether or not
you click the button) and serve you or your friends particular ads on Facebook
as a result. For those who are not on Facebook, or who aren&amp;rsquo;t logged in, it can
still tie the profile to your IP address, and could theoretically link that
information to you, should you subsequently show up on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-isnt-unique-to-facebook&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t unique to Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; third-party apps do exactly the same thing, although few have the
reach of Facebook. The other big player is &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;, who tracks you (by IP
address) using Google Analytics, which many websites have installed in exchange
for free website statistics, and tracks you (by Google profile) using Google&amp;rsquo;s
new &amp;ldquo;&#43;1&amp;rdquo; button released as part of the Google Plus social network. Since Google
makes so much of its money from advertising, its interest in knowing which sites
you visit is pretty self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other social networks&amp;rsquo; widgets, such as Twitter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Tweet&amp;rdquo; button, the Pinterest
button, etc. also are certainly tracking who is accessing them, but to date
there have been fewer examples of them using this information to build profiles
of people. Social &amp;ldquo;plugin&amp;rdquo; applications, like AddThis, ShareThis and Disqus also
compile profiles of people as a way to present them what they think will be the
most useful social network buttons (and in some cases links to other content),
but it&amp;rsquo;s less clear whether they&amp;rsquo;ve been using that information for any other
purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations concerned about the privacy of their visitors &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;especially
those at risk of being tracked by repressive governments who could lean on
social networking companies to release user data&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; should carefully weigh
whether a given social widget is worth the risk in privacy. Moreover, these
organizations should absolutely provide a privacy policy that specifically lays
out what&amp;rsquo;s being collected and by whom, and may also want to consider suggesting
ways for those at risk to circumvent this data tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several organizations I&amp;rsquo;ve seen have prominently linked to the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor Project&lt;/a&gt;, and there are good resources from
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/wp/blog-safely&#34;&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20150910225919/https://ethanzuckerman.com/2006/10/01/anonymous-blogging-with-wordpress-and-tor/&#34;&gt;Ethan Zuckerman&lt;/a&gt;
on using Tor for anonymous blogging. There are also
&lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/&#34;&gt;several&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20150910225919/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/&#34;&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt; that
anonymize your browsing. Any of these methods would defeat tracking by social
networking widgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-two-click-solution-for-websites&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A two-click solution for websites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For organizations that want to ensure their users are only tracked by social
networking websites if they explicitly opt-in, there&amp;rsquo;s an exciting new
development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last week, as a response to the German privacy commissioner&amp;rsquo;s declaration
against social networking buttons, German website Heise has
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.heise.de/extras/socialshareprivacy/&#34;&gt;released a script&lt;/a&gt; that
disables social networking buttons by default.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script renders three social networking buttons &amp;ndash; Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Like, Google&amp;rsquo;s
&#43;1 and Twitter&amp;rsquo;s Tweet &amp;ndash; as greyed-out images hosted locally on the website.
After flicking a virtual switch, site visitors enable the actual social
networking button, which calls the web servers of Facebook, Google or Twitter
and would thus trigger the data collection. There&amp;rsquo;s also a handy settings button
to the right, that allows you to permanently opt-in to one or all of the
services for that site. You can

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight at Philly NetSquared I gave a short presentation on Google Plus and its
implications for nonprofits and social change work. You can

&lt;p&gt;(Google insists on referring to its system as &amp;ldquo;Google&#43;&amp;rdquo; but that wreaks havoc on
search engines, so throughout this post I&amp;rsquo;ll be referring to it as &amp;ldquo;Google Plus&amp;rdquo;
instead.)&lt;/p&gt;

        title=&#34; &#34;
      
    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Google Plus is only designed to have profiles for people, similar
to core Facebook profiles. Business profiles, like Facebook Pages, are likely
coming in the future. In the meantime you could try to circumvent this by
creating a &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo; with the name of an organization, but just like with
Facebook, that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2007/08/free-ranger-ric.html&#34;&gt;risks having your profile deleted&lt;/a&gt;.
(More on that in a moment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One positive aspect of this is that it gets easier to organize among people you
know. Until now, social networks have basically had two models: Public profiles
that don&amp;rsquo;t require real names, like MySpace and Twitter, and private profiles
that do require real names, like Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Google Plus, profiles are both public and under people&amp;rsquo;s real names,
meaning that if you have a list of donors, supporters or volunteers you could
conceivably find each one who has a Google Plus profile relatively easily.
(LinkedIn has a similar setup, but is largely used for job-seeking and, unlike
Google Plus, requires an account in order to see profiles &amp;ndash; so at best they are
only semi-public.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;professionalizing-communications&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Professionalizing communications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar&#34;&gt;The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
you&amp;rsquo;ll recognize the concepts of formal and informal communication. Unlike
communication among friends, Google Plus is designed to formalize
communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way you might segment or target an email to a particular list of
supporters&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organic groups simply don&amp;rsquo;t have a mode to interact or connect, with the minor
exception of in a post&amp;rsquo;s comments. That said, if you know who your

around a &amp;ldquo;multi-hub small world&amp;rdquo; concept.

must be linked to a single actual human person. No pseudonyms, no fictional
characters, no group identities, no profiles of pets or inanimate objects, no
creative or destructive bots. For some online organizers, in contrast to the
chaos of Twitter or MySpace this might seem like a welcome shift.&lt;/p&gt;

    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Google CEO Eric Schmidt
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/2011/09/28/140879480/who-are-you-really-activists-fight-for-pseudonyms&#34;&gt;said last year&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the errors that the Internet made a long time ago is that there was not
an accurate and non-revocable identity-management service. &amp;hellip; And the best
example of an identity-management service today that&amp;rsquo;s reasonably reliable is
Facebook.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember what gets left behind when we require real
names in a social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First: It&amp;rsquo;s dangerous for some people.&lt;/strong&gt; Survivors of domestic violence,
political activists in many societies around the world, marginalized folks such
as LGBT people, and anyone who has reason to be anonymous online will simply not
be able to participate. Researcher danah boyd has gone so far as to call Google
Plus&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;nymwars&amp;rdquo; policy
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2011/08/04/real-names.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;an abuse of power&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who most heavily rely on pseudonyms in online spaces are those who
are most marginalized by systems of power. &amp;ldquo;Real names&amp;rdquo; policies aren&amp;rsquo;t
empowering; they&amp;rsquo;re an authoritarian assertion of power over vulnerable
people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Geek Feminism Wiki has an extensive entry on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://geekfeminism.fandom.com/wiki/Who_is_harmed_by_a_%22Real_Names%22_policy%3F&#34;&gt;who is harmed by &amp;ldquo;real names&amp;rdquo; policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second is the loss of creativity &amp;ndash; and creative activism&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; when we demand
that people tie their writings to a legal identity. (Boyd points out that
somehow Facebook&amp;rsquo;s strict policy on real names has never required Lady Gaga to
identify as Stefani Germanotta.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of social movements, we sometimes remember organizers through
real names (Martin Luther King, Jr.; Mohandas Gandhi) but often we know them
through names other than what might have been their legal identity: Malcolm X,
Mother Jones, Sylvia Rivera, or Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Ross and known
throughout her work as &amp;ldquo;Moses&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activists often use &amp;ldquo;movement names&amp;rdquo; of one type or another, like the Chinese
pro-democracy activist Michael Anti,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnbc.com/2011/03/08/facebook-closes-china-activists-account-for-pseudonym.html&#34;&gt;recently deleted under Facebook&amp;rsquo;s policy&lt;/a&gt;.
Jillian C. York points out at the EFF that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/case-pseudonyms&#34;&gt;successful online organizing is often done under a kind of group pseudonym&lt;/a&gt;,
as with the Egyptian uprising originating in posts on the &amp;ldquo;We Are All Khaled
Said&amp;rdquo; Facebook page. And of course the use of &amp;ldquo;handles&amp;rdquo; online is older than the
Web itself &amp;ndash; arguably older than the Internet, if you consider communication
tools like ham radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us would argue that far from being an &amp;ldquo;error&amp;rdquo; as Google&amp;rsquo;s Schmidt would
have it, online use of pseudonymous, anonymous, temporary, artistic, or
otherwise &amp;ldquo;unofficial&amp;rdquo; identities has been a core reason for the Internet&amp;rsquo;s
growth and strength. So if this does represent a broader shift toward
identity-focused social networks, activists will need to adapt and, in some
cases, circumvent these policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update, Oct. 5, 2015: The EFF has launched an initiative called
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/global-coalition-facebook-authentic-names-are-authentically-dangerous-your-users&#34;&gt;The Nameless Coalition&lt;/a&gt;,
calling on all social networks to step back from &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo; policies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-plus-hangouts&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google Plus Hangouts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Google Plus profiles, Google has launched a new video-chatting
system called Google&#43; Hangouts. This could be useful to online organizers both
for quick collaboration with colleagues and for impromptu webinars with
supporters. Although there are participation limits, for small groups this
offers a welcome no-cost alternative to platforms like WebEx or GoToMeeting.&lt;/p&gt;

where your people are&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are aspects of every social network I like and don&amp;rsquo;t like, as an organizer
and as a participant. It&amp;rsquo;s absolutely true that online social networks are
seeking to monetize our friendships, volunteer us to generate content for their
platforms, and sell the data they collect on us &amp;ndash; the oft-repeated truism that
&amp;ldquo;if you&amp;rsquo;re not paying for the product, you are the product.&amp;rdquo; But as an
organizer, I go on Facebook the same way that in earlier eras organizers might
have gone to churches or pubs: Not because those are places they&amp;rsquo;d personally
hang out but because that&amp;rsquo;s where the people are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;rsquo;t be swayed by &amp;ldquo;shiny object syndrome&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; if your supporters, fellow
activists, or sympathetic communities aren&amp;rsquo;t showing up on Google Plus, there&amp;rsquo;s
no reason for you to prioritize it. As with any online platform, your organizing
strategy should come first, technology second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20150910223614/http://communitytech.net/&#34;&gt;Community TechKnowledge Foundation&lt;/a&gt;
announced today a grant of $10,000 for a nonprofit that submits a description of
their mission &amp;ndash; in the form of a poem. Along with the grant, the poetry will be
turned into a song by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20150910223614/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-10-07/entertainment/ct-live-1007-william-dillon-20101007_1_evanston-florida-man-redemption-song&#34;&gt;Bill Dillon&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.floridainnocence.org/&#34;&gt;Innocence Project of Florida&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also secondary prizes for $5,000, $1,000, and guitars autographed by
members of Los Lonely Boys. (A tertiary prize, &amp;ldquo;tech grants&amp;rdquo; from CTK, probably
aren&amp;rsquo;t worth it as they only last for three months and lock you into their
proprietary system &amp;ndash; but you don&amp;rsquo;t have to include an application for these
grants in your submission.)&lt;/p&gt;

The deadline is March 28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t feel up to turning your mission into poetry, this is a great
opportunity to solicit submissions from your supporters. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t win,
you may have some useful new language to talk about what you do!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2011/03/grant-your-mission-poem/&#34;&gt;A grant for your mission, as a poem&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has initiated a project it calls
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20101219022105/http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/p/cause/&#34; title=&#34;Read more about Chrome for a Cause&#34;&gt;Chrome for a Cause&lt;/a&gt;,
in which every person who uses its Chrome browser will generate a small donation
for each tab that they open, to a charity of their choice. The project runs from
Dec. 15 to 19, and includes five charities: The Nature Conservancy, charity:
water, Doctors Without Borders, Un Techo para mi Pa&amp;iacute;s, and Room to Read. Google
will donate a
&lt;a
  data-dead-link=&#34;http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/p/cause/tos/&#34;
  href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/dead-link/&#34;
  title=&#34;http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/p/cause/tos/ [dead link]&#34;
  &gt;combined total of up to $1 million&lt;/a
&gt;
to the five charities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have your Chrome tabs count, you must first install a small extension to your
copy of Chrome. There&amp;rsquo;s a maximum of 250 tabs per day, and one tab per second,
that count toward your cause. You also

  title=&#34;http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/p/cause/privacy/ [dead link]&#34;
  &gt;must have a Google account&lt;/a
&gt;
to submit your totals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-like-about-it&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What I like about it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s great that Google is directing money to nonprofits, and not the usual
milquetoast public awareness charities, but organizations that do good, concrete
things. And it&amp;rsquo;s nice that on the Chrome for a Cause page, they have links to
&amp;ldquo;donate directly&amp;rdquo; under the description of each organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also nice that people who participate in Chrome for a Cause get to choose
&amp;ndash; from Google&amp;rsquo;s list of five charities &amp;ndash; where they want their portion of the
money generated to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-im-less-thrilled-about&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m less thrilled about&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cleverness of it is lost on me.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll donate money for every tab you
open, if you download an extension for it,&amp;rdquo; seems like if a car dealer said,
&amp;ldquo;Hey, for the month of December, every time you open the back left door of your
car, I&amp;rsquo;ll donate 10 cents to a charity that you choose. (But you have to come in
to the dealership to get a counter installed on that door.)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get that it&amp;rsquo;s tied to the use of the browser, and anything that gets people to
use the browser more (and set up Google accounts if they don&amp;rsquo;t have them) is a
plus for them. So it makes sense for &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; to put the tabs-for-charity
schtick on this project, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see how it makes any kind of sense at all
to the public. Which leads me to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It feels creepy that Google is exploiting the holiday season of goodwill to
get more usage out of its browser.&lt;/strong&gt; I know that corporations don&amp;rsquo;t make
donations to nonprofits without getting something in return, but this seems more
gratuitous than usual. And, of course, it could breed the ultimate form of
&amp;ldquo;slacktivism&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; ineffective digital activism &amp;ndash; in which opening a tab to
donate a few cents assuages a person&amp;rsquo;s sense of needing to contribute to making
the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not even a glancing mention on their page of how much is donated for each
tab.&lt;/strong&gt; Once you download the extension, it calculates how much your tabs have
donated so far, in things rather than dollars (e.g. 0.3 trees; the full
breakdown is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.googleblog.com/2010/12/browse-for-good-cause.html&#34; title=&#34;Read Google&#39;s blog entry describing Chrome for a Cause&#34;&gt;on their blog&lt;/a&gt;),
so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to know exactly how much each tab is worth in monetary terms. But
even measuring it in what it will buy, why should we have to install the
extension in order to find out what our possible impact will be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It promotes the idea of organizational competition &amp;ndash; the nonprofit
deathmatch.&lt;/strong&gt; Take a look at the screenshot above: You can &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; donate 9
vaccinations, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; 23 books, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; one person&amp;rsquo;s clean water. I know that these
kinds of competitions are all the rage &amp;ndash; they even have a name,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20150911000054/http://www.moderngiving.com/2009/07/crowdsourcing-philanthropy-greater-transparency/&#34; title=&#34;About crowdsourcing philanthropy on Modern Giving&#34;&gt;crowdsourcing&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20101009111313/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/kindness/post/2009/11/innovative-crowdsourcing-philanthropy-contest-launches-on-facebook-today-with-5-million-in-total-winnings/1&#34; title=&#34;News report on the crowdsourced Chase Community Giving on Facebook&#34;&gt;philanthropy&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;ndash; but it&amp;rsquo;s frustrating to me how it&amp;rsquo;s rooted in a scarcity model, in which
organizations must compete rather than collaborate. I&amp;rsquo;m sure, for instance, that
each of these nonprofits is encouraging their members to &amp;ldquo;donate tabs&amp;rdquo; to them,
rather than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, since Google has capped its donation at $1 million, and it&amp;rsquo;s relatively
certain they will reach that amount given their reach, what participants are
really voting for is allocation. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve got a million dollars; vote with your
tabs on what percentage should go to The Nature Conservancy,&amp;rdquo; they&amp;rsquo;re saying. So
every vote to one organization takes money away from another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-it-could-be-better&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;How it could be better&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be transparent about what the impact is.&lt;/strong&gt; Google should say, on the Chrome
for Cause page itself, how many tabs you have to open to plant a tree (for
instance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrate concrete actions from the charities.&lt;/strong&gt; Doctors Without Borders
doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; ask people for money &amp;ndash; they have, for instance, a big campaign
to pressure governments
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20100702205106/http://www.msfaccess.org:80/&#34; title=&#34;Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines&#34;&gt;not to prevent affordable generic medicines&lt;/a&gt;
from being exported to the Global South, and another advocating for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20110218075603/http://www.starvedforattention.org/take-action.php&#34; title=&#34;Starved for Attention&#34;&gt;humanitarian food aid that provides adequate nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.
At the end of each day, when a person submits their votes, why not end with
something like &amp;ldquo;Great! Now here are more things you can do to support this
charity&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick one charity each week/month/season.&lt;/strong&gt; This might be a little
controversial, since more exposure for more nonprofits seems like a good thing,
and part of this project&amp;rsquo;s appeal is the ability for people to pick where their
money goes. But by acting as a kind of &amp;ldquo;matching grant&amp;rdquo; for a nonprofit &amp;ndash;
&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll donate $1 million to this organization, if our users open at least 1
million tabs this week&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Google can generate exposure for the organization and
its browser, without forcing groups into the boxing ring against one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick one &lt;em&gt;charity field&lt;/em&gt; each week/month/season.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of choosing a
single environmental group for its donation, Google could choose to donate money
equally to five or ten nonprofits in the same sector. This would encourage
collaboration between nonprofits working on the same issue to work together in
asking their supporters to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support nonprofits year-round.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s cute that Google is donating some money
in December, to (sort of) coincide with the holidays, but there&amp;rsquo;s no reason they
can&amp;rsquo;t do this for longer than a week. By making it an ongoing project and
cycling through different organizations, Google can donate money to nonprofits,
but also give its far more lucrative asset: attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your thoughts on Chrome for a Cause?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2010/12/google-chrome-cause-nonprofit-deathmatch-strikes-again/&#34;&gt;Google Chrome for a cause, or, nonprofit deathmatch strikes again&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a nonprofit with a mailing address, you may have already received the
card in the mail from Facebook: An invitation to claim your organization&amp;rsquo;s
Facebook Places page.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/places&#34; title=&#34;Visit Facebook Places&#39; home page&#34;&gt;Facebook Places&lt;/a&gt;
allows people to &amp;ldquo;check in&amp;rdquo; when they&amp;rsquo;re at your organization, publicizing you
to their friends. Places also allows companies to offer &amp;ldquo;deals&amp;rdquo; to people who
check in (like 10% off), although how that applies to a nonprofit is less clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already had a Facebook Page, when you go to claim your Facebook Place,
you&amp;rsquo;ll be prompted to merge the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new, merged page will look a little different from your old page. Among
other differences, what were formerly tabs across the top of your page will now
be links underneath your profile picture, similar to the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20110826093738/http://www.johnhaydon.com/2010/12/new-and-improved-facebook-profiles-a-screen-shot-tour/&#34; title=&#34;View a walk-through of the new Facebook Profiles from John Haydon&#34;&gt;new Facebook Profiles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s where the trouble starts: On your new merged Facebook Page &amp;ndash; as
the picture above shows &amp;ndash; you will no longer be able to specify a default
landing tab.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Default landing tabs are a powerful way to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20110826093738/http://fblandingtabs.wikispaces.com/Nonprofitexamples&#34; title=&#34;View a slideshow on creating default landing tabs by Debra Askanase&#34;&gt;convert visitors to fans&lt;/a&gt;.
Instead of new visitors simply being dumped on your Wall, nonprofits (and other
companies) could create custom tabs, welcoming new visitors, introducing them to
the organization, and encouraging them to &amp;ldquo;Like&amp;rdquo; the nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Facebook announced they were
&lt;a

  href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/dead-link/&#34;
  title=&#34;Read Beth Kanter&#39;s discussion about this change on Facebook [dead link]&#34;
  &gt;dropping support for new custom tabs that used Facebook Markup Language (FBML)&lt;/a
&gt;,
although you could still specify a particular application tab as your landing
page, including
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20110826093738/http://savedelete.com/how-to-create-impressive-welcome-page-for-your-facebook-fan-page-absolutely-free.html&#34; title=&#34;A guide to creating custom landing tabs from SaveDelete blog&#34;&gt;custom-page-creating applications&lt;/a&gt;.
Indeed, a custom landing tab was recommended as a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20110826093738/http://www.diosacommunications.com/facebookbestpractices.htm#19&#34; title=&#34;Read the Facebook best practices for nonprofits&#34;&gt;Facebook best practice&lt;/a&gt;
for nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, however, it appears all visitors to a nonprofit&amp;rsquo;s Facebook Page will be
directed to the Wall. What&amp;rsquo;s more, with tabs being de-emphasized by their move
to smaller links under your profile, it&amp;rsquo;s less obvious how new visitors can find
out more about your organization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since at the moment this only appears to affect Places pages, and any existing
Pages merged with a Place, it&amp;rsquo;s unclear whether this is simply a roll-out bug or
something more long-term. But given that Facebook
&lt;a href=&#34;https://nonprofitorgs.wordpress.com/2009/12/13/attn-nonprofits-major-changes-coming-soon-to-facebook-fan-pages/&#34; title=&#34;Read about the changes to the Pages and Profiles over time, by Heather Mansfield&#34;&gt;first removed the default landing tab a few months ago&lt;/a&gt;,
reinstating it after an uproar &amp;ndash; but only &amp;ldquo;temporarily&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; I would guess that
this is the direction of things on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s possible that this might only apply to pages in some categories, e.g.
nonprofits but not companies; I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to any company Facebook pages
to investigate this on. It appears a default landing tab has
&lt;a
  data-dead-link=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/help/#%21/help/?question=87334&#34;
  href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/dead-link/&#34;
  title=&#34;Read Facebook&#39;s help topic on default landing tabs and Community Pages [dead link]&#34;
  &gt;never been available&lt;/a
&gt;
on things categorized as Community Pages &amp;ndash; initially auto-generated from
interests listed on profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It appears that default landing tabs are not available on Places pages &amp;ndash; or
any traditional Pages &amp;ldquo;merged&amp;rdquo; with Places. My prediction is that it won&amp;rsquo;t stick
around for the rest of the Pages on Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not clear to me what the advantage of this is to Facebook, other than a
general &amp;ldquo;standardness of experience&amp;rdquo; for users. Yet without any way to
(substantially) customize the Wall, this seems like a net loss for both
organizations and regular users. New visitors will no longer have an easy way to
be introduced to an organization, and organizations will have to carefully
cultivate their Wall to &amp;ndash; at any moment &amp;ndash; appeal to both current fans and new
visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what possible solutions out there, although one might be to make
sure your Page&amp;rsquo;s image/logo quickly communicates exactly what your nonprofit is
about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on these changes to Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Michael Arrington has a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/28/women-in-tech-stop-blaming-me/&#34;&gt;tedious post on TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;
up about the fact that there aren&amp;rsquo;t as many women in technology, or &amp;ndash; more to
the point &amp;ndash; in positions of leadership in technology companies or on panels at
tech conferences isn&amp;rsquo;t men&amp;rsquo;s fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you know what? I think he&amp;rsquo;s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Men aren&amp;rsquo;t to blame for the lack of representation by women in technology.
Nor, clearly, are women to blame. What causes this disparity? One word:
Sexism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But wait!&amp;rdquo; you cry. &amp;ldquo;Surely there must be someone &lt;em&gt;carrying out&lt;/em&gt; this sexism.&amp;rdquo;
And indeed, that&amp;rsquo;s true &amp;ndash; many individual men, and some women, often put forth
ideas or enact policies that are rooted in sexism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But sexism is bigger than any one person; it&amp;rsquo;s a system in which our entire
society &amp;ndash; certainly the privileged, Western technology community &amp;ndash; is
enmeshed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often, such systematic discrimination as treated as discrete, individual
acts, disconnected from the larger reality. And so Arrington can complain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every damn time we have a conference we fret over how we can find women to
fill speaking slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By attempting to fill a quota, he thinks he can inoculate himself (or his
conference) against the charge of sexism. (He then makes the absurd point that,
really, women are getting annoyed by being asked to speak at conferences all the
time &amp;ndash; which tends to undo that inoculation a small bit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Men are privileged most directly by sexism, of course, which is why
Arrington&amp;rsquo;s post is so galling.&lt;/strong&gt; He suggests &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; need women &amp;ldquo;who go out and
start companies&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;complain about how there are too few women in
tech,&amp;rdquo; as if justice in the technology community and the larger society is only
the job of those who are marginalized, and never the ones who hold power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this is due to the retreat from full-fledged feminism into what Tim Wise
has called
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.timwise.org/1999/12/springing-the-diversity-trap-thoughts-on-how-not-to-defend-affirmative-action/&#34;&gt;the diversity trap&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo;
in which a commitment only to &amp;ldquo;different backgrounds&amp;rdquo; motivates any kind of
diversity. He&amp;rsquo;s writing about racism and affirmative action, but the movement is
the same &amp;ndash; away from working to end sexism or racism, and toward an anodyne
pledge to provide different perspectives. Wise quotes then-California Gov.
Ronald Reagan, upon signing affirmative action into law in 1974:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time and experience have shown that laws and edicts of non-discrimination are
not enough. Justice demands that each and every citizen consciously adopt and
accentuate a commitment to affirmative action, which will make equal
opportunity a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Providing opportunity alone won&amp;rsquo;t work when the playing field is already
tilted. Simply inviting speakers from a field from which women have been
systematically filtered since birth is too late in the game.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrington makes the mind-boggling assertion that women are at an advantage,
because there are so few of them that the press wants to write about the ones
who &amp;ldquo;make it.&amp;rdquo; This is the
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/the-talented-tenth/&#34;&gt;talented tenth&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
turned on its head &amp;ndash; that because
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastcompany.com/section/women-in-tech-2009&#34;&gt;a few individuals&lt;/a&gt; have
struggled against overwhelming odds toward success, and that the media naturally
wants to cover such extraordinary stories, the institutional oppression that
existed to make those stories exceptional in the first place somehow disappears.
As the death threats against tech writer
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/TECH-CHRONICLES-A-daily-dose-of-postings-from-2567591.php&#34;&gt;Kathy Sierra&lt;/a&gt;
demonstrated, straight-up sexism still holds sway among large parts of this
male-domainted field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the sub-field of nonprofit technology, many if not most of the people I look
to are women: &lt;a href=&#34;https://bethkanter.org/&#34;&gt;Beth Kanter&lt;/a&gt;,

the top of my head (sorry if I missed anyone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet even in this space, women leaders are repeatedly
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://netsquared.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=118511&#34;&gt;judged on their appearance&lt;/a&gt;.
In the nonprofit field as a whole, despite there being more women than men in
leadership,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20100825172812/http://www.nptimes.com/Feb03/sr1.html&#34;&gt;they&amp;rsquo;re still paid less&lt;/a&gt;
across the board, although the gap is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philanthropy.com/article/gap-grows-in-salaries-for-ceos-study-finds/&#34;&gt;slowly shrinking&lt;/a&gt;.
In part this may explain the success of women in this field, as any kind of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/08/10/majors&#34;&gt;social work&lt;/a&gt;
is seen as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://island94.org/2009/10/Social-work-is-womens-work-so-we-dont-care.html&#34;&gt;women&amp;rsquo;s work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrington is feeling put-upon because he&amp;rsquo;s experiencing women who point out the
inequity in representation and leadership as a personal attack on him. It&amp;rsquo;s not
that unusual of a response &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s the same experience white folks have when
people of color talk about racism, straight people have when queers demand equal
treatment, and able-bodied individuals have when persons with disabilities
expect equal access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how oppression is set up &amp;ndash; forcing individuals to compete against one
another &lt;em&gt;as individuals&lt;/em&gt; and rendering its pervasive influence invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Arrington is right to be outraged. But the outrage should be focused
on the sexism that keeps both men &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; women down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;rsquo;s women who bear the overwhelming amount of oppression from sexism,
it&amp;rsquo;s a force that inhibits men&amp;rsquo;s growth as well. Men are expected to take on
unbelievable obstacles, toil without complaint and settle for stunted emotional
connections to family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many successful men, when confronted with evidence of institutionalized sexism,
feel that their accomplishments are being degraded, because they had to struggle
mightily under such harsh conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What too many men miss is the reality that the system under which they face
such inhumane expectations is the &lt;em&gt;same one&lt;/em&gt; that limits the potential of
women.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are individual men and women who help to support such a system.
Their actions are rightly be identified and they should be given the support and
resources to help to change these actions. But changing individual actions isn&amp;rsquo;t
enough by itself &amp;ndash; the system must be confronted as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blogher.com/&#34;&gt;BlogHer&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://womenwhotech.org/&#34;&gt;Women Who Tech&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://shesgeeky.org/&#34;&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s Geeky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://webgrrls.com/&#34;&gt;WebGrrls&lt;/a&gt;
conferences are one component, as a place for women to strategize and support
one another; continually pressing for more visibility for women at tech
conferences dominated by men who are
&lt;a href=&#34;https://surfette.typepad.com/blogher/2005/11/do_women_warm_t.html&#34;&gt;simply unaware of women techies&lt;/a&gt;
is another component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be even more exciting? A conference of male-identified folks
interested in supporting women who take on positions of leadership in the tech
community.&lt;/strong&gt; Part of that involves men looking at what gets in the way of them
supporting more women in &amp;ldquo;their&amp;rdquo; space, and men working through that might not
always look pretty to women. But belittling women who point out systematic
inequities as Arrington does is a reactionary response to being asked to account
for one&amp;rsquo;s privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This needs to be an effort undertaken by both women and men, not for some
vague goal of &amp;ldquo;diverse voices&amp;rdquo; but as a way to realize all of our potentials in
technology and beyond.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updates:&lt;/strong&gt; Allyson Kapin has a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastcompany.com/1685780/too-few-women-tech-stop-playing-blame-game&#34;&gt;great list of specific suggestions&lt;/a&gt;
to address this issue, and Michael Arrington followed up by saying he knows more
needs to be done, but he might delete the post in favor of something
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/arrington/status/22454841699&#34;&gt;far less painful&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s
likely that to really address sexism &amp;ndash; if that is what he wants to do &amp;ndash; he&amp;rsquo;ll
have to face some painful truths, however. Jon Pincus says it much more
succinctly:
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.talesfromthe.net/jon/?p=1552&#34;&gt;Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s hard. Take some responsibility.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. It&amp;rsquo;s worth pointing out that Allyson Kapin, Shireen Mitchell, Jocelyn
Harmon and I are proposing a session on just this topic at next year&amp;rsquo;s Nonprofit
Technology Conference:

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online activism didn&amp;rsquo;t come out of nowhere.&lt;/strong&gt; The methods and tactics of
online activists &amp;ndash; be they individuals or international nonprofits with
hundreds of staff &amp;ndash; are drawn on social change movements and community
organizing strategies that have been tried, experimented with, failed, tweaked,
and tried again, long before the Internet existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there&amp;rsquo;s often a disconnect between what&amp;rsquo;s seen as online activism &amp;ndash;
referred to as &amp;ldquo;slacktivism,&amp;rdquo; sometimes accurately but oftentimes sloppily &amp;ndash;
and community-based social change. And that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m covering today at the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nten.org/ntc/&#34;&gt;2010 Nonprofit Technology Conference&lt;/a&gt;, along with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120204213748/http://www.communityorganizer20.com/&#34;&gt;Debra Askanase&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://amysampleward.org/&#34;&gt;Amy Sample Ward&lt;/a&gt;, in a session called
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20100713125922/https://www.ntenonline.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?webcode=SessionDetails&amp;ses_key=9e27f6a5-1720-4ad1-8ee0-058a2260bcbb&#34;&gt;Bringing Community Organizing Into Online Campaigns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-mean-by-community-organizing&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What I mean by community organizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of community organizing has always been weighted with both political
implications and social context, and so one person&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of what
&amp;ldquo;counts&amp;rdquo; as community organizing &amp;ndash; and what its implications are &amp;ndash; will vary
from the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For my purposes here, I&amp;rsquo;m using community organizing as the idea that
individuals have more power to create change by coming together than by acting
alone. Community organizing empowers these individuals, creates long-term change
and challenges the structure of power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously I&amp;rsquo;ve argued that with the rise of &amp;ldquo;web 2.0,&amp;rdquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2009/09/gurus-are-not-enough-call-organizers-organizing-social-media&#34;&gt;everybody is learning how to be a community organizer&lt;/a&gt;.
The principles of how to mobilize friends and neighbors around a particular
issue &amp;ndash; whether it&amp;rsquo;s a social cause or a hot party &amp;ndash; are being learned every
time someone creates a Facebook event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think it&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to look at how traditional, on-the-street community
organizing can inform purposeful online activism. Once we move beyond the &amp;ldquo;blast
all your friends with a link to a petition&amp;rdquo; phase, there are concrete
&lt;em&gt;strategies&lt;/em&gt; to which we can turn. And many of those strategies are drawn
directly from a century or more of social mobilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;principles-of-community-organizing&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Principles of community organizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are five primary ideas in which traditional community organizing is
rooted: &lt;strong&gt;movement-building, strategy, community accountability, going where the
people are, and cultivating leadership&lt;/strong&gt;. There are more principles and
strategies to be sure (and you may disagree whether these five are at the top),
but I see these as having the most to say to online activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;organizing-for-a-movement&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Organizing for a movement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community organizing is based on long-term strategy. &amp;ldquo;Empowerment&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; that is,
facilitating the realization among individuals and communities that they have
the power to effect change &amp;ndash; is not something you expect to occur overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How this relates to online activism:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Every action should be pointing people
toward a greater goal.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s straightfoward enough to get people out to a
single event, or taking a single online action. But cultivating those
individuals so they see their action as part of a long-term campaign is
something that takes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;strategy-strategy-strategy&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Strategy, strategy, strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about the fact that social media isn&amp;rsquo;t about doing &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt;
organizing, it&amp;rsquo;s about
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2009/05/social-change-takes-more-social-media&#34;&gt;doing it better&lt;/a&gt;. A theory
of social change is critical to an individual or organization engaging in online
activism. Will signing this petition against the war put pressure on elected
leaders to alter policies? Will this upcoming rally (or &amp;ldquo;virtual march&amp;rdquo;)
demonstrate a community&amp;rsquo;s growing power &amp;ndash; or is it &amp;ldquo;busy work&amp;rdquo; for supporters
who haven&amp;rsquo;t been asked to do anything in a while?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How this relates to online activism:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Too many nonprofits, unfortunately,
seem to engage in token actions that don&amp;rsquo;t move things forward as part of an
overall strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; And even when a given action is a part of a strategy,
nonprofits are often vague about communicating that to supporters. Exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;
will calling this legislator advance a critical piece of legislation? Is there a
chance the bill will actually pass? If not, there could be other legitimate
strategy to build public support for it &amp;ndash; things are long-term, remember? &amp;ndash;
but organizations must be clear to supporters that &amp;ldquo;victory&amp;rdquo; in this case won&amp;rsquo;t
be a new law, but, for instance, 10 vocal new supporters in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;being-accountable-to-a-real-world-community&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Being accountable to a real-world community&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community organizers are often derided as rabble-rousers, troublemakers, or
professional activists who dupe people into following them. But true community
organizing isn&amp;rsquo;t about swooping in and ginning up outrage by telling the locals
to fight the man. It&amp;rsquo;s generally approached as much more
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2009/10/finding-movements-voice-online-social-networks-social-change&#34;&gt;Freirian&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;ndash; taking direction from and being accountable to the local community.
Organizers bring their experience of tactics and strategy, and may serve to
inspire people that they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have the power to make change. But the causes
around which communities organize should come from the community itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How this relates to online activism:&lt;/em&gt; Technology is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2009/04/fire-food-why-theres-no-such-thing-twitter-revolution&#34;&gt;too often seen as a strategy in and of itself&lt;/a&gt;.
But the Internet and social media &amp;ndash; like fax machines, phone trees and the
printing press before them &amp;ndash; are simply tools, able to be used tactically to
great effect, but only when part of a larger strategy. Focusing on the tech
divorces a campaign from its community, and leaves the online organizer in the
role of the &amp;ldquo;expert&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to use Twitter to clean up your
city!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; leaving little room for a community to actually control the direction
of a campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remembering that the community&amp;rsquo;s long-term strategy is paramount &amp;ndash; and being
willing to listen, discern and collaborate with that community &amp;ndash; will help keep
the people whose lives and livelihoods are on the line actually in charge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;go-where-the-people-are&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Go where the people are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social change happens in communal spaces &amp;ndash; not always public, but nearly always
intimate to the community as it exists. Workers&amp;rsquo; homes and pubs in the labor
movement, black churches in the US civil rights movement, gay bars in the gay
rights movement, and college campuses in numerous student movements attest to
this fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How this relates to online activism:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Rarely will it be effective to create a
private &amp;ldquo;walled garden&amp;rdquo; social network that you have to convince people to join
and become active on.&lt;/strong&gt; Different communities are on different social networks
online &amp;ndash; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2008/10/using-social-networks-social-change-facebook-myspace-more&#34;&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s important to know where your constituencies are&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;ndash; on Facebook, MySpace, Twitter or somewhere else. The places where a community
is most active socially are most likely to be the places where it&amp;rsquo;s most
effective to organize. If you&amp;rsquo;re organizing in a sensitive environment, you may
have to establish some level of privacy around your campaign, but only &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt;
you&amp;rsquo;ve already engaged people where they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cultivating-sustainable-leadership&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cultivating sustainable leadership&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an area to which traditional community organizing aspires, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t
always succeed. The temptation for a &amp;ldquo;charismatic leader&amp;rdquo; to emerge and
indefinitely control the direction of a social change campaign can be strong.
Participants may initially be relieved that they don&amp;rsquo;t have to &amp;ldquo;take the heat&amp;rdquo;
when things get tough, and can look to their leader for direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet time and again we&amp;rsquo;ve seen movements collapse when the leader &amp;ndash; having
captured power within the movement or had it thrust upon him or her &amp;ndash; burns out
or becomes unable to continue. Increasingly in the past half-century, social
movements have attempted to make their approaches more sustainable by
cultivating leadership, bringing people from the margins into the center and
mentoring and encouraging emerging leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How this relates to online activism:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Seek to put yourself out of a job.&lt;/strong&gt;
The best online campaigns are the ones that are self-sustaining. Encourage those
who are taking the most action to begin to brainstorm new ideas and actions for
the campaign. Reward people who are doing the most recruiting, and make them
feel that they&amp;rsquo;re a part of the &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; of the organizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nonprofits &amp;ndash; and I know this will be hard to hear &amp;ndash; stop pretending that
you&amp;rsquo;re the only organization active on the issue. Support your members who
become active in allied groups and consider working in coalitions early and
often. Not only will this cement your supporters&amp;rsquo; dedication to the cause, it
will build the identity of a long-term movement, rather than a limited
&amp;ldquo;card-carrying member&amp;rdquo; view of participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;help-continue-this-conversation&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Help continue this conversation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, I&amp;rsquo;ve embedded the slides of our presentation, which goes beyond the
things I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed above and includes an exciting interactive workshop
component &amp;ndash; so if you&amp;rsquo;re at NTC,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120202003828/https://www.ntenonline.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?webcode=SessionDetails&amp;ses_key=9e27f6a5-1720-4ad1-8ee0-058a2260bcbb&#34; title=&#34;View time, location and other information on this session&#34;&gt;please do stop by&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as I wrote awhile back
&lt;a href=&#34;https://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2009/06/listening-leads-to-engagement-relationship-models.html&#34;&gt;in a similar discussion on Beth Kanter&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old model of nonprofit/social change theory is that the organization has
the power. You sign up with an organization &lt;em&gt;in order to&lt;/em&gt; have an impact; the
organization mobilizes its supporters successfully based on their numbers but
fundamentally the strategy is coming from the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new model of social change embodied in the social web is the wisdom of the
network. The power isn&amp;rsquo;t inherent in the organization though they may act as
the catalyst. In this case people become part of the organization &lt;em&gt;as part of
the process&lt;/em&gt; of having an impact. Indeed, many of the most effective
supporters may be &amp;ldquo;outside&amp;rdquo; the organization on paper. The value comes from
the network rather than the membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in some ways, the dynamics of social media is actually driving us toward more
sustainable, honest organizing, in which advocacy groups can provide expertise,
training, resources and education, but it&amp;rsquo;s the grassroots that is mobilizing to
effect change. Looked at this way, a lot of day-to-day online organizers have
already taken up the best parts of offline community organizing &amp;ndash; and it&amp;rsquo;s on
the &amp;ldquo;professional activists&amp;rdquo; to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I welcome any thoughts, comments or ideas. How do you see community organizing
informing &amp;ndash; or being separate from &amp;ndash; online activism? What examples have you
seen of successes or failures?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ivan Boothe&lt;/strong&gt; is a social change scholar with a degree in peace and conflict
studies. With hundreds of hours of training in community organizing and years of
experience in real-world social change, he&amp;rsquo;s excited about the ways in which
social media can, when used strategically, amplify the ability of activists to
change the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2010/04/what-online-activism-can-learn-community-organizing/&#34;&gt;What online activism can learn from community organizing&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Last week, Special Envoy to Sudan Gen. Scott Gration sat down with
representatives from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120201194307/http://savedarfur.org/&#34;&gt;Save Darfur&lt;/a&gt;
and the student network &lt;a href=&#34;https://standnow.org/&#34;&gt;STAND&lt;/a&gt; for an unprecedented live
Q&amp;A, webcast directly from the White House website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event served as the launch of an initiative the White House is calling
&lt;a href=&#34;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2009/11/04/%e2%80%9cask-us%e2%80%9d-engaging-sudan-strategy&#34; title=&#34;White House: Ask U.S., Engaging on Sudan Strategy&#34;&gt;Ask U.S.&lt;/a&gt;,
&amp;ldquo;an effort to reach out to the advocacy communities and to solicit questions on
the U.S. Sudan policy from activists deeply and passionately engaged&amp;rdquo; around
Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNSXeMkiZ_M&#34; title=&#34;Whitehouse.gov: Ask U.S. live webcast (YouTube)&#34;&gt;Watch a recording of the webcast.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save Darfur Coalition Executive Director Jerry Fowler and STAND Student Director
Layla Amjadi were joined by Samantha Power &amp;ndash; now the National Security
Council&amp;rsquo;s Senior Director for Multilateral Affairs, but known more widely as the
author of &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;A Problem from Hell&amp;rdquo;: America and the Age of Genocide&lt;/em&gt;, a history of
the United States&amp;rsquo; response to mass atrocities from Armenia to Rwanda. Power
herself was an inspiration for many of the anti-genocide organizations which
exist today, including the two that participated in this online exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Full disclosure: I was a co-founder of the Genocide Intervention Network,
STAND&amp;rsquo;s parent organization, and worked there until 2008.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;calling-for-transparency-pushing-for-accountability&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Calling for transparency, pushing for accountability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The webcast was notable not just for its interactivity &amp;ndash; members of both
STAND and Save Darfur were encouraged to

which were then asked directly of Gration on air &amp;ndash; but for its
accountability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some anti-genocide activists have been
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/28/AR2009092802336_pf.html&#34; title=&#34;Washington Post: U.S. Envoy&#39;s Outreach to Sudan Is Criticized as Naive&#34;&gt;critical of the Obama administration&lt;/a&gt;
for positioning Darfur and Sudan as a prominent human rights issue during the
campaign, but [taking little
action](&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20091125041222/http://www.genocideintervention.net:80/network/pressroom/pressreleases/2009/09/29/2864&#34;&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20091125041222/http://www.genocideintervention.net:80/network/pressroom/pressreleases/2009/09/29/2864&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Sudan Advocacy Groups React To General Gration&amp;rsquo;s Statements to The Washington
Post&amp;rsquo;) since the election. Here was a chance for anti-genocide activists to put
the White House&amp;rsquo;s point person on Sudan on the spot and demand answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The responses from Gration &amp;ndash; Power, other than introducing and concluding the
event, largely remained silent &amp;ndash; were generally panned by activists watching
the chat via Twitter and Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;In his opening remarks Gration said &amp;lsquo;we
owe you answers&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; you still do,&amp;rdquo; said

  &gt;Will Fischer&lt;/a
&gt;.
&amp;ldquo;I respect the hell out of Sam Power but I&amp;rsquo;m not going to buy Gration&amp;rsquo;s vague
answers just because she&amp;rsquo;s sitting there,&amp;rdquo; said Genocide Intervention Network
Director of Membership
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jgoldbeck/status/5599046520&#34;&gt;Janessa Goldbeck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bec Hamilton, who is writing a book about the advocacy movement around Sudan and
has worked with the Genocide Intervention Network, reported that the questions
for Gration had to be
&lt;a href=&#34;http://bechamilton.com/2009/11/09/ask-us-responding-to-activists-or-managing-them/&#34; title=&#34;Bec Hamilton: Responding to activists or managing them?&#34;&gt;submitted ahead of time&lt;/a&gt;,
so it&amp;rsquo;s a little surprising his answers weren&amp;rsquo;t more sure-footed. Hamilton
&lt;a href=&#34;https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/11/11/gration-and-power-answer-activists-questions-on-sudan/&#34; title=&#34;ForeignPolicy.com: Gration and Power answer activists&#39; questions on Sudan&#34;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;
a former official at the State Department had seen the event as a way to
&amp;ldquo;manage&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;noise&amp;rdquo; of activists, but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, the shoe was on the other foot. Activists were given the
opportunity to ask follow-up questions, and they pursued that avenue with such
vigor that any fear of them being co-opted by their well-publicized access to
the White House ceased to be a concern. What was a concern was the
administration&amp;rsquo;s inability to provide concrete answers to the advocates&amp;rsquo;
questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the White House was hoping the webcast would placate activists who had been
critical of US policy on Sudan, it seemed to do just the opposite.&lt;/strong&gt; Goldbeck,
responding to Gration&amp;rsquo;s statement that &amp;ldquo;we know we are going to be held
accountable by you,&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jgoldbeck/status/5599234951&#34;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes you will,&amp;rdquo; a message widely reposted by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Diamond-Falk, a spokesperson for the Save Darfur Coalition, was more
amiable about the exchange with the White House. &amp;ldquo;As much transparency as they
can give us, they will do, without compromising their policy,&amp;rdquo; she told me. &amp;ldquo;He
wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to disclose as much information as we asked, which is going to
happen in these sorts of things. &amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s a very delicate line, so engaging
policy behind the scenes will still be necessary.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;making-the-online-qa-possible&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Making the online Q&amp;A possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrea Clarke, director of communications for the Save Darfur Coalition, pitched
the idea of a &amp;ldquo;live online town hall&amp;rdquo; to Gration&amp;rsquo;s communications director in
August. &amp;ldquo;We thought it would be something beneficial for activists to be
directly engaged around the [Sudan] policy,&amp;rdquo; Clarke said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After suggesting the idea of an online town hall to Gration, the special envoy
suggested the student organization STAND be a part of the conversation as well.
&amp;ldquo;The special envoy&amp;rsquo;s office was very committed to answering as many questions as
possible, and the involvement of STAND was key to that process,&amp;rdquo; Clarke said.
&amp;ldquo;It made for a greater diversity of questions, and we feel the activist
community was very well represented.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gration&amp;rsquo;s travel itinerary made scheduling difficult, and in the end it occurred
without much advance notice. Clarke said Save Darfur received at least 500
questions from activists for the special envoy, and &amp;ldquo;I think if we have more
lead time we&amp;rsquo;ll have even more questions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Micah Sifry
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120201200824/http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/ask-us-state-department-20-sudan-darfur-and-public-engagement&#34; title=&#34;TechPresident: Ask U.S., State Department 2.0 on Sudan, Darfur and Public Engagement&#34;&gt;wrote on Monday&lt;/a&gt;,
the willingness of the State Department and White House to engage openly and
publicly with advocates who are often critical seems unprecedented. Given the
negative response to Gration&amp;rsquo;s responses, might this kind of transparency be
short-lived?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarke said she had &amp;ldquo;no reason to believe there won&amp;rsquo;t be&amp;rdquo; similar events in the
future as part of the &amp;ldquo;Ask U.S.&amp;rdquo; program. Gration &amp;ldquo;appears to be working very
hard to get feedback,&amp;rdquo; she said. Gration himself
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20121114080249/http://www.state.gov/s/sudan/listserve/131887.htm&#34; title=&#34;US State Department: Innovative Engagement with Advocacy Groups on Sudan&#34;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;
that the State Department is &amp;ldquo;eager to continue an active and robust dialogue
with the advocacy community.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layla Amjadi of STAND lamented the lack of specificity in Gration&amp;rsquo;s answers,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-2009-11-11-voa5-69822412/415509.html&#34; title=&#34;Voice of America: Student Activists Encourage White House to Raise Anti-Genocide Concerns about Darfur&#34;&gt;telling&lt;/a&gt;
the Voice of America that activists &amp;ldquo;were really frustrated by how vague the
policy review was on benchmarks and pressures and incentives.&amp;rdquo; She called for an
approach involving bigger players than Gration alone &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Obama, Biden and
Clinton&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20121114043535/http://www.standnow.org/blog/response-tuesdays-ask-us-meeting&#34;&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that we&amp;rsquo;ve got their ear, let&amp;rsquo;s talk to them. They&amp;rsquo;re
looking for us to hold them accountable. So let&amp;rsquo;s do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are certainly questions that activists who are voices for those who
cannot necessarily be heard right now have, and it&amp;rsquo;s important that those
questions are answered by the administration,&amp;rdquo; said Diamond-Falk. &amp;ldquo;The fact that
[Gration] engaged the Save Darfur Coalition and the student movement &amp;hellip;
proves that activists have to have a voice on this issue and in this
administration.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-future-of-high-level-advocacy&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The future of high-level advocacy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We certainly hope that this can be one tactic that other advocacy groups can
use to demand accountability of the administration,&amp;rdquo; Clarke said. &amp;ldquo;I hope this
is something that&amp;rsquo;s taken on board by communications departments of other
advocacy groups.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most organizations may not have the political pressure necessary to convince
public officials to host a live, online questioning.&lt;/strong&gt; The broad constituency
that has been active around Darfur and Southern Sudan for the past five years
was a definite advantage to making the webcast happen, Clarke said, as was
President Obama&amp;rsquo;s stated support on the campaign trail for resolving the crises
in Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gration&amp;rsquo;s willingness to engage activists on the issue, however, may have been
the most critical element&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine a live Q&amp;A happening without
a public official&amp;rsquo;s support. &amp;ldquo;Gration appears to be working very hard to get
feedback,&amp;rdquo; Clarke said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engaging more than one organization made the proposal more attractive to
public officials.&lt;/strong&gt; Save Darfur asked for the event, and the special envoy&amp;rsquo;s
office suggested a representative of student activists join as well. Gration&amp;rsquo;s
office wanted the event to be seen as legitimately representing the entire Sudan
advocacy movement, not simply a single pressure group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cautious criticism seemed to have paid off in helping make the dialogue
possible.&lt;/strong&gt; Many Sudan advocacy organizations including STAND and Save Darfur
have been publicly supportive of the special envoy, while continuing to push for
more transparency and specifics. Gration had been criticized by some activists
as &amp;ldquo;naive&amp;rdquo; with some going so far as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://newrepublic.com/article/70919/the-ingratiator&#34; title=&#34;The New Republic: The Ingratiator&#34;&gt;demanding his resignation&lt;/a&gt;,
but responses from Save Darfur and STAND&amp;rsquo;s parent organization, the Genocide
Intervention Network, had largely
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20091112172651/http://www.genocideintervention.net/blog/2009/11/05/should_gration_be_fired_gi_net_responds&#34; title=&#34;Genocide Intervention Network: Should Gration be fired? GI-Net responds.&#34;&gt;not suggested&lt;/a&gt;
that level of displeasure. &amp;ldquo;I think that we don&amp;rsquo;t always agree with the special
envoy&amp;rsquo;s office, but we maintain an open line of communication, and that has
helped us a lot,&amp;rdquo; Clarke said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As for the issue of Sudan, could pressure on legislators coupled with
Gration&amp;rsquo;s limited responses provoke more Congressional action?&lt;/strong&gt; The online
event with Gration directly followed a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20091023040807/http://www.pledge2protect.net/&#34; title=&#34;Pledge2Protect Conference&#34;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;
for anti-genocide activists, including a full day of meetings with members of
Congress. Diamond-Falk pointed out that following the student lobbying and live
webchat, 44 members of Congress signed a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20121114034243/http://allafrica.com/stories/200911130892.html&#34; title=&#34;AllAfrica: Letter from U.S. Members of Congress to the President on China&#39;s Involvement in Sudan&#34;&gt;letter to President Obama&lt;/a&gt;
ahead of his visit to China, a major trading partner of Sudan&amp;rsquo;s, urging the
president to make Sudan a priority in his discussions there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarke said if a second online Q&amp;A occurs, Save Darfur &amp;ldquo;will be pushing for
questions that are extremely direct from those who are suffering on the ground,&amp;rdquo;
suggesting the event can not only be a chance to connect activists to the
administration, but survivors of the genocide and wars in Sudan as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning, the fundraising application
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120201194319/http://www.causes.com/&#34;&gt;Causes&lt;/a&gt;
quietly shut down their presence on MySpace. In their email to administrators of
Causes on MySpace, they wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the work you&amp;rsquo;ve done on Causes on MySpace. Due to the lack of
activity on MySpace, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to focus our efforts on the Causes
application on Facebook. On Friday at noon EDT, we will be removing all causes
from MySpace. In the meantime, you can post a link to a cause on Facebook (or
create one at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120203065755/http://apps.facebook.com/causes/&#34;&gt;http://apps.facebook.com/causes&lt;/a&gt;)
asking your members to change over. We appreciate the work you&amp;rsquo;ve put into
your cause community on MySpace and we hope that the broader functionality
available on the Causes application on Facebook will offer you even more
opportunities to raise awareness, advocate for change and fundraise for your
nonprofit. If you have questions, please email &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/11/causes-abandons-184674-nonprofit-supporters-myspace/mailto:support@causes.com&#34;&gt;support@causes.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At that exact moment,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20091024070619/https://myspace.com/causesapp&#34;&gt;Causes on MySpace&lt;/a&gt;
had 184,674 current users.&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s 184,674 individual people (minus a few
nonprofit staffers) who had taken the time to install an application on MySpace
specifically so they could show their support for a nonprofit charity or
advocacy group on the social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, those nonprofit badges have been removed from each of those 184,674
profiles, with no notice to those supporters as to why their Causes badges have
disappeared. (The application&amp;rsquo;s page on MySpace is still up, with no
notification that it&amp;rsquo;s being shut down; new users who try to add it get a
message saying it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;temporarily unavailable.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No notice has been posted to the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20091108190641/http://exchange.causes.com/&#34;&gt;Causes blog&lt;/a&gt;;
Susan Gordon, the Senior Nonprofit Coordinator of Causes, said in an email to
me, &amp;ldquo;We didn&amp;rsquo;t put the announcement on the blog before because the number of
people using the MySpace app is so small.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-causes-on-myspace-failed-lack-of-engagement&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why Causes on MySpace failed: Lack of engagement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not clear from either email when Causes decided to shut down the MySpace
side of its operation, or why it chose to do so within just a few days. Causes
began on Facebook and has always had more users on there (currently 35.2
&lt;em&gt;million&lt;/em&gt;). From Causes&amp;rsquo; point of view, MySpace was probably more trouble than
it was worth given the percentage of their total users, though I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call
nearly 200,000 people a &amp;ldquo;small&amp;rdquo; number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causes on Facebook had, from the beginning, more to offer nonprofits than its
MySpace version.&lt;/strong&gt; Nonprofits could, for instance, send email messages to all
their Causes supporters on Facebook &amp;ndash; something not possible using Fan Pages or
Facebook Groups over 2,000 people. On MySpace, probably due to the limitations
of the network itself, there was no such functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, in one of my first write-ups on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2008/10/using-social-networks-social-change-facebook-myspace-more&#34;&gt;using social networks for fundraising and advocacy&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;strong&gt;I highlighted Causes not as a great way to fundraise but as a great way to
engage members&lt;/strong&gt;. There was less chance for engagement on MySpace; though
supporters could still put up a badge demonstrating their support and make
donations, in my experience those were actually the least useful parts of
Causes.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2009/04/hello-washington-post-dolllars-per-facebook-donor-is-not-the-right-metric-for-success.html&#34;&gt;As I wrote earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who expects Causes &amp;ndash; or any social networking approach &amp;ndash; to replace
their development director doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand the nature of social networks.
It&amp;rsquo;s not about building a more effective ATM &amp;ndash; sorry, &amp;ldquo;donor list&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s
about cultivating relationships with your most passionate supporters, giving
them ways to speak in their own voice and connecting them with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most young folks who are on social networks get this, since it&amp;rsquo;s how they&amp;rsquo;re
relating socially on these networks already. (As danah boyd has said, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re
not addicted to computers, we&amp;rsquo;re addicted to friends.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I suspect this was a limitation imposed by MySpace, so I don&amp;rsquo;t
necessarily fault Causes. The lesson here, though, is that &lt;strong&gt;a fundraising
widget is not enough of a draw&lt;/strong&gt;. The chance for engaging supporters &amp;ndash; not just
in things like one-way email blasts but in things like leaderboards showing the
top fundraisers among supporter-created Causes &amp;ndash; is, in the end, the &amp;ldquo;killer&amp;rdquo;
part of this app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-this-means-for-nonprofits-on-myspace&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What this means for nonprofits on MySpace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Despite repeated claims that MySpace is &amp;ldquo;dead,&amp;rdquo; I continue to think it&amp;rsquo;s a
smart move for many nonprofits to have a presence there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sociologist danah boyd has documented the clear
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.danah.org/papers/talks/PDF2009.html&#34; title=&#34;The Not-So-Hidden Politics of Class Online&#34;&gt;socioeconomic&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.danah.org/papers/talks/ICA2009.html&#34; title=&#34;MySpace vs. Facebook: A Digital Enactment of Class-Based Social Categories Amongst American Teenagers&#34;&gt;differences&lt;/a&gt;
between MySpace and Facebook, and Amy Sample Ward has stressed the need to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ssir.org/articles/entry/first_and_foremost_know_your_community&#34; title=&#34;First and Foremost: Know your Community&#34;&gt;know your community and where it is&lt;/a&gt;.
Facebook, after all, was built by and for middle- and owning-class
college-educated folks &amp;ndash; exactly those people who fill nonprofit staffs. But if
your organization
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20151003162738/http://www.marketingfornonprofits.org/2009/11/are-online-communities-just-as.html?showComment=1257526462528#c6820898715423075412&#34;&gt;serves a different community&lt;/a&gt;,
then simply going where your staff is familiar might not be the best choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want to do peer-to-peer fundraising on MySpace, there are still
widgets like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120129184134/http://www.chipin.com/&#34;&gt;ChipIn&lt;/a&gt;
available for that purpose. They won&amp;rsquo;t have the &amp;ldquo;built-in&amp;rdquo; feel that Causes on
MySpace did, but they&amp;rsquo;re fairly easy to guide people through with a quick
training or video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-this-means-for-nonprofit-fundraising-on-social-networks&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What this means for nonprofit fundraising on social networks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bigger lesson here is that you can&amp;rsquo;t rely on third-party, often for-profit
services to support your organization&amp;rsquo;s interests.&lt;/strong&gt; To Causes, leaving MySpace
to focus on its core community on Facebook made good business sense, but
certainly those organizations left in the lurch on MySpace feel otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Rebecca Leaman
&lt;a
  data-dead-link=&#34;http://twitter.com/rjleaman/status/5430851340&#34;
  href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/dead-link/&#34;
  title=&#34;http://twitter.com/rjleaman/status/5430851340 [dead link]&#34;
  &gt;said it best&lt;/a
&gt; &amp;ndash;
don&amp;rsquo;t put &amp;ldquo;all fundraising eggs in one third-party basket!&amp;rdquo; These services are
useful, and can help your organization advance its mission, but it&amp;rsquo;s not
accountable to you &amp;ndash; and you need to have other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;letting-go-of-your-message-holding-on-to-your-relationships&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Letting go of your message, holding on to your relationships&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (and many others) have often said that in order to be successful in social
media, nonprofits need to be willing to give up some control over their message
&amp;ndash; to let supporters speak in their own voice. What Causes&amp;rsquo; move has exposed,
though, is that while it&amp;rsquo;s important to let go of your message, you still need
to have control over your relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonprofits don&amp;rsquo;t own or even control the connections they have with their
supporters in these spaces&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; the comments, messages, badges and memberships
of supporters within social networks are all locked within those social networks
and are used under contract (terms of service) from the social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20091115121119/https://developers.facebook.com/connect.php&#34;&gt;Facebook Connect&lt;/a&gt;
or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120201191441/http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/&#34;&gt;OpenSocial&lt;/a&gt;
allow those relationships to be exposed elsewhere, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the same as
control. If the social network or service decides the nonprofit has run afoul of
the contract, or the company goes bankrupt, cancels services or features, or
gets sold to a different company who does &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s nothing an organization
will be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s important to have multiple channels of communication with
supporters and to continually try to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://orgnet.com/sna.html&#34;&gt;move people toward the center&lt;/a&gt; of your organization
by deepening involvement, so that if you lose them in one space they don&amp;rsquo;t
simply fade off into the ether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-source-open-data-open-networks&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Open-source, open data, open networks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy Sample Ward makes some great points that social change communities may have
to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://amysampleward.org/2009/11/06/new-on-ssir-letting-technology-lead/&#34;&gt;take the lead on technology&lt;/a&gt;
by pushing for more openness and transparency. I&amp;rsquo;ve written before, for
instance, that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2009/01/community-blogs-run-better-open-source-software&#34;&gt;community blogs run better on open-source software&lt;/a&gt;,
and I think in principle the same is true for social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nonprofits and social change movements will always have to go where the
supporters are &amp;ndash; and in many cases that will mean closed, proprietary,
walled-garden social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would it look like if nonprofits and social change movements &amp;ndash; which
these third party applications often use to market themselves as effective and
&amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; started demanding some openness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it reasonable to assert that organizations and individuals should &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo; their
relationships, even when within a proprietary network? Can long-term social
change happen when connections must be re-built on each new online social
network to be developed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Causes on MySpace may be no more, I think this event raises some important
questions for the relationship between nonprofits, social change, and for-profit
software and services. What are your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen
&lt;a href=&#34;https://readwrite.com/causes_on_myspace/&#34;&gt;Read Write Web&amp;rsquo;s coverage&lt;/a&gt; of this,
but I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth a read. As I say above, I think Causes&amp;rsquo; supposed
&amp;ldquo;failures&amp;rdquo; to raise tons of money for nonprofits is less of an issue than some
might think (for a great perspective on this, see
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120305054803/http://afine2.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/wash-post-disses-causes-on-facebook/&#34;&gt;Allison Fine&lt;/a&gt;).
But as many of the commenters suggest, the way forward is to explore mechanisms
for open-sourcing our relationships from these closed, proprietary systems, be
they widgets like Causes or networks like Facebook and MySpace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/11/causes-abandons-184674-nonprofit-supporters-myspace/&#34;&gt;Causes abandons 184,674 nonprofit supporters on MySpace&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today at the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20091013231101/http://www.peacejusticestudies.org/conference&#34; title=&#34;Read more about the conference&#34;&gt;Peace and Justice Studies Association 2009 Conference&lt;/a&gt;
at Marquette University, I hosted a workshop called,
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20091013231106/http://www.peacejusticestudies.org/conference/sessions.php?con=C.4&#34;&gt;Finding the Movement&amp;rsquo;s Voice: Online Social Networks and Social Change&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subtitle of this workshop could be, &amp;ldquo;Social change has always relied on
social networks &amp;ndash; they just weren&amp;rsquo;t called Facebook.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking
concretely about the &lt;em&gt;strategy&lt;/em&gt; of using online tools for social change. This
won&amp;rsquo;t be an ain&amp;rsquo;t-it-cool presentation of shiny technology, nor will it be a
technical exploration of complicated software. It will be an interactive how-to
on making social change work more effective by using online social technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I did use a set of slides, the workshop was participatory and the slides
were mostly illustrative; I hope to publish them here and on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/rootwork&#34;&gt;Slideshare&lt;/a&gt; with a voiceover soon, but
they&amp;rsquo;re probably not worth posting otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I can post is an extended set of resources and tools for those pursuing
social change and want to engage folks online. In addition, much of my
presentation was drawn on earlier presentations and writing, including:&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gurus, mavens and experts convey information &amp;ndash; they tell you &lt;strong&gt;the way things
are&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizers, conversely, cultivate leadership and facilitate a community&amp;rsquo;s
exploration of its vision &amp;ndash; they offer a way to see &lt;strong&gt;how things could be&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, we need an accurate picture of how things are before we can
strategize ways to improve them, and so it&amp;rsquo;s important to continually listen to
and learn from the experts, taking from them relevant information and measuring
it against our own experience and knowledge. But folks involved in social change
&amp;ndash; online or offline &amp;ndash; can&amp;rsquo;t stay there. We have to be willing to step up and
do the difficult organizing work that leverages our knowledge and experts&amp;rsquo; data
into something larger: a movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;everybody-organizing-everybody&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Everybody Organizing Everybody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community organizers are a natural fit for &amp;ldquo;web 2.0&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the movement from
one-way broadcasting on the web to two-way coversation and connection. I want to
expand the definition a little bit, however, and suggest that online organizing
goes far beyond the professional, experienced organizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the defining aspects of web 2.0 is social &lt;em&gt;organization&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; People are
constantly presented with their social circles in visual media: Facebook news
feeds, MySpace top friends, Twitter updates, etc. In short, more people can see
their network, in a much more literal way. This is especially true for young
adults (currently Millennials) who might have social networks scattered across
wide geographic areas and are less firmly rooted to a specific place through
vocational, familial or other commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communities at the margins of society have always had a more visceral
understanding of their social networks, which are often the sites of social
change planning and strategizing &amp;ndash; consider the role of black churches in the
US civil rights movement, or gay bars and bathhouses in the early Stonewall era
of the gay rights movement. So I don&amp;rsquo;t want to suggest that this phenomenon of a
community visualized is necessarily new for everyone, but I think it is new for
many folks in the mainstream of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The online &amp;ldquo;social web&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; social networks and social media &amp;ndash; allows people
to organize their social connections&lt;/strong&gt;, not simply to put them in order, but to
connect and collaborate with others. Evite invitations and Facebook events are
clear examples of this, as is Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increasingly, the social web is teaching everyday folks how to be community
organizers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s usually gurus, however, who get &amp;ndash; or take &amp;ndash; the credit for this
transformation. On the contrary, I see it as a much more grassroots bubbling-up
of organizing skills. Everyone has the ability to organize and inspire others;
the current tools are simply making those skills more visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fewer-leaders-more-leadership&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fewer Leaders, More Leadership&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Organizations and societies,&amp;rdquo; wrote Bruce Kokopeli and George Lakey, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;do need
leadership&lt;/em&gt;, but they &lt;em&gt;do not need leaders&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/09/gurus-are-not-enough-call-organizers-organizing-social-media/&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They argued for a shared value
of leadership, in which many individuals took responsibility for the direction
of a group, but didn&amp;rsquo;t invest the institutional power in a single person to call
the shots. A critical part of this feminist approach relies on cultivating
leadership among more and more individuals. Everyone has a stake, and everyone
has a say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are particular challenges putting that theory into practice in an
organization, the good news is that movements, particularly those engaging in
online social change, are particularly positioned to take advantage of this
approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fact that more people are organizers, and that everyone can exercise
leadership, does not mean that there is no role for the full-time organizer.&lt;/strong&gt;
Indeed, the &amp;ldquo;professional&amp;rdquo; organizer becomes more important than ever, passing
on stories and lived experience, and sharing a pedagogy for cultivating new
leadership. What fades away is the positioning of some people within a movement
as &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo; to whom everyone looks for direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulo Freire calls such an approach &amp;ldquo;co-intentional education,&amp;rdquo; in which each
person is both teacher and student. Those with more experience may seek to
inspire or ask questions to further dialogue, but as a way to further develop
strategy rather than dictate to or control the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempting to liberate the oppressed without their reflective participation in
the act of liberation is to treat them as objects which must be saved from a
burning building; it is to lead them into the populist pitfall and transform
them into masses which can be manipulated. &amp;hellip; [T]he oppressed must see
themselves as women and men engaged in the &amp;hellip; vocation of becoming more fully
human.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/09/gurus-are-not-enough-call-organizers-organizing-social-media/&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem like heavy or strident language in the context of online petition
drives or peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns. But my goal is to push social
change organizers to look toward the larger picture. What sort of movement do
you want to build in the long-term? What role do people play in that movement &amp;ndash;
is it a passive one of letter-signing and donation-giving, or an active one of
working from the ground up for lasting change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social marketing experts are adept at building brand loyalty, or encouraging the
formation of an identity around an issue. They know how to sell the idea of
&amp;ldquo;social good&amp;rdquo; to the public at large, using people&amp;rsquo;s goodwill toward a cause as
a way to market to them through a given company, and increase donations to a
partner charity. Well-known examples of this are the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.red.org/&#34;&gt;RED campaign&lt;/a&gt; and Starbucks&#39;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20090207001439/http://www.ethoswater.com/&#34;&gt;Ethos Water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online organizers turn a skeptical eye toward &amp;ldquo;social good&amp;rdquo; and social
marketing.&lt;/strong&gt; It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean such projects aren&amp;rsquo;t worth exploring or learning
from, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that everyone involved is a charlatan simply out to
make a buck. But selling people an identity, even a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; one, is fundamentally
different from organizing for social change. Freire again: &amp;ldquo;Conviction cannot be
packaged and sold; it is reached, rather, by means of a totality of reflection
and action.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/09/gurus-are-not-enough-call-organizers-organizing-social-media/&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movement building also goes beyond electoral organizing.&lt;/strong&gt; Folks working for
social change often form common cause with those organizing around a political
candidate, and there is of course much to be learned and shared between the two
practices. But whereas elections are centered around a single charismatic
leader, a fully-engaged, vibrant social change movement consists of both shared
vision and shared leadership. Elections give people an answer, while movements
ask people a question &amp;ndash; and then encourage them to speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of selling or giving supporters a solution, then, online organizers
are involved in cultivation.&lt;/strong&gt; There are pieces of both social marketing and
electoral organizing present in online organizing, of course, and experts in
these fields can be a useful source of data, but we should be wary of
replicating these other models when it comes to leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over at the NetSquared blog, Joe Solomon
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20090525121410/http://www.netsquared.org:80/jaded-about-social-media-for-change-lets-talk-about-it&#34;&gt;provided a great roundup&lt;/a&gt;
of reasons people might be &amp;ldquo;jaded about social media for change&amp;rdquo; and ways they
overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting Twitter DMs from top players in the nonprofit tech and
social media for change space &amp;ndash; sharing how they&amp;rsquo;re unmotivated or jaded with
using the web and social media for change. As if the phrase has lost its
meaning somehow. Or a bubble had been burst. I know I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling the same
way. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling it too &amp;ndash; or come across others with a
similar vibe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe runs through some great responses from a whole bevy of
social-media-for-change folks, including me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the comments on Joe&amp;rsquo;s blog post was from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://texansagainsthunger.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Texans Against Hunger&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s what
the author said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny, I clicked on this post from Twitter expecting a realistic conversation
about the limitations of social media tools. Instead, it appears everyone took
your question about being jaded to mean &amp;ldquo;How can I get un-jaded,&amp;rdquo; and not,
&amp;ldquo;Should I be jaded?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assumption of most twitters above seems to be that these tools work
because they&amp;rsquo;re cool OR they&amp;rsquo;ve built a career around them, so if you&amp;rsquo;re
feeling jaded due to lack of results or encouraging metrics, get over it and
get back to your (disappointing) work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMO, social media tools are pretty poor at changing anything that takes more
than one or two mouse-clicks. Sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s all you need &amp;ndash; making a
donation, sending petitions, affecting website ratings, flooding online polls,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most change, unfortunately, doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen at the end of a mouse-click. But in
the long run, these tools also do a good job of hoovering up potential
participants for offline actions that will make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps our jadedness comes from a disconnect between the revolutionary nature
of the tool, and its less-than-mindblowing uses? If that&amp;rsquo;s the case we&amp;rsquo;ll be
managing our own expectations, given enough time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought the author made some good points that &amp;ldquo;social change techies&amp;rdquo; would do
well to keep in mind. I can see how the author might have gotten the impression
that some or all of the folks in Joe&amp;rsquo;s roundup are simply shiny-tech pushers. I
won&amp;rsquo;t try to speak for them, but I do think they aren&amp;rsquo;t blindly following the
latest tech hype and hoping it will change the world &amp;ndash; many of them have clear
social change strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own background is rooted in a) on-the-ground community organizing, including
100&#43; hours of training and many times that in actual organizing, and b) academic
study of how nonviolent social change can be successful (my degree is in peace
and conflict studies). I know &amp;ldquo;social change&amp;rdquo; can be kind of a squishy term (and
even more so the strategy-free &amp;ldquo;social good,&amp;rdquo; which Katrin Verclas has
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20130122173735/http://katrinskaya.tumblr.com/post/89065553/charity-versus-change-and-why-aid-is-bad-part-1&#34;&gt;amply discussed&lt;/a&gt;),
so I want to position myself as specifically interested in fundamental social
change, at the political, social, economic and cultural levels. I don&amp;rsquo;t see the
challenges as being easily fixed, or short-term, or things that can be addressed
with a few pieces of legislation or a few institutional reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With that in mind, I think social media and social networking hasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely
matured as part of long-term social change.&lt;/strong&gt; Where it has been getting
integrated into social justice organizing, it&amp;rsquo;s largely been outside the United
States, in places like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20110907201210/http://info.howcast.com/press/releases/facebook-google-youtube-mtv-howcast-columbia&#34;&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ethanzuckerman.com/2006/09/16/alaa-on-egyptian-blogs-and-activism/&#34;&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;.
And even there, while we can see important strategic concessions, not enough
time has really passed to see the extent to which social media helped advance
social justice campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I entirely share the author&amp;rsquo;s frustration with &amp;ldquo;tech for social change&amp;rdquo;
discussions that fawn over the technology and don&amp;rsquo;t engage on the level of
strategic change.&lt;/strong&gt; I saw this happening in particular during the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2009/04/fire-food-why-theres-no-such-thing-twitter-revolution&#34;&gt;Moldovan &amp;ldquo;Twitter revolution&amp;rdquo; discussion&lt;/a&gt;
(which Joe linked to in his post). This &amp;ldquo;revolution&amp;rdquo; seemed to captivate a lot
of armchair activists on Twitter, mostly because it involved Twitter. They
seemed to miss the fact that a) Twitter wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually a big part of the
organizing strategy, and b) the campaign itself didn&amp;rsquo;t end up seriously
threatening the regime; at best it was a mild skirmish and it certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t a
&amp;ldquo;revolution&amp;rdquo; of any kind.
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2009/04/fire-food-why-theres-no-such-thing-twitter-revolution&#34;&gt;Which is not to diminish the hard work of social justice organizers in Moldova.&lt;/a&gt;
Mad props to them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The author&amp;rsquo;s point about social media providing an outlet for people&amp;rsquo;s
activism that sucks away people&amp;rsquo;s time for real social change is an excellent
one.&lt;/strong&gt; (A similar dynamic happens every two to four years in the US, when
community organizers see their ranks cannibalized by electoral organizing.)
Charles Lenchner has written brilliantly about this, using the principle
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011455/http://nten.org/blog/2008/04/22/mission-over-membership-in-online-advocacy&#34;&gt;mission over membership&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many nonprofits orchestrate &amp;ldquo;petition drives&amp;rdquo; that aren&amp;rsquo;t about advocating
for anything other than larger membership rolls. Too many groups ask
constituents to make calls to an elected official without even feigning an
attempt at explaining how those calls will help achieve a goal or contribute to
a longer-term campaign. &lt;strong&gt;The author is absolutely right that too many
nonprofits have no social change theory at all; indeed they&amp;rsquo;re more interested
in self-perpetuation than winning&lt;/strong&gt; (often referred to as the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-revolution-will-not-be-funded&#34;&gt;nonprofit industrial complex&lt;/a&gt;).
And when those groups get their hands on social media, they do incredibly
un-strategic things with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fact that social media can be used unstrategically, however, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean
it has to be.&lt;/strong&gt; To pull a line from my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2009/04/fire-food-why-theres-no-such-thing-twitter-revolution&#34;&gt;earlier post on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;,
political pamphlets, phone trees and jam-the-faxes must have seemed like
strategies in and of themselves when each technology first came out. But smart
social justice organizers recognized them as tactics, and such tactics were only
effective when deployed as part of an overall strategy for social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you do &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; organizing &amp;ndash; it means you (can) do it
&lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;, or at least differently.&lt;/strong&gt; You still have to use all the old skills of
coalition-building, strategic planning, creative social action, managing
relationships and preventing burnout. None of that goes away just because you&amp;rsquo;re
engaging with people on Facebook instead of in town halls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to get &amp;lsquo;round to the original question &amp;ndash; the reason I don&amp;rsquo;t feel jaded when
I look at all the unstrategic uses of social media is because I&amp;rsquo;m focused on the
end goal, the social change. Social justice organizers are a pretty creative
bunch. Throughout history, they&amp;rsquo;ve taken a wide variety of technologies and used
them strategically to move their campaigns forward. I have no doubt social media
has and will become one tool in many organizers&amp;rsquo; toolbelts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the past two days, posts began popping up on Twitter with the tag
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pman&amp;f=live&#34; title=&#34;View recent Twitter posts with this tag&#34;&gt;#pman&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ndash; short for Piata Marii Adunari Nationale, the largest city square in the
capital of Moldova. Students were
&lt;a href=&#34;https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/04/07/moldovas-twitter-revolution/&#34; title=&#34;&#39;Moldova&#39;s Twitter Revolution&#39; on Foreign Policy&#39;s net.effect&#34;&gt;organizing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since yesterday&amp;rsquo;s announcement that Moldova&amp;rsquo;s communists have won enough
votes to form a government in Sunday&amp;rsquo;s elections, Moldova&amp;rsquo;s progressive youth
took to the streets in angry protests. As behooves any political protest by
young people today, they also turned to Facebook and Twitter to raise
awareness about the planned protests and flashmobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writers like Evgeny Morozov, above, initially characterized this as a
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/2009/04/inside-moldovas/&#34; title=&#34;&#39;Inside Moldova&#39;s Twitter Revolution&#39; on the Wired blog&#34;&gt;Twitter revolution&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo;
modeled in the real-time use of Twitter seen during the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20090604075703/http://www.digiactive.org/2009/04/02/tactic-twitter-the-new-journalism-part-2/&#34; title=&#34;&#39;Tactic: Using Twitter to Coordinate Protests in London&#39; on DigiActive&#34;&gt;G20 protests&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://votereportindia.pbworks.com/w/page/7646282/FAQ&#34; title=&#34;Vote Report India&#34;&gt;election monitoring&lt;/a&gt;
and crowd-sourcing the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sftorch/status/785987727&#34; title=&#34;Twitter: SFTorch&#34;&gt;location of a certain torch&lt;/a&gt;
when it was passing through San Francisco. (Thus a little different than the
traditional
&lt;a href=&#34;https://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2009/03/7-more-charities-and-charitable-giving-foundations-that-tweet-and-where-to-find-more.html&#34; title=&#34;&#39;Nonprofits That Tweet: Roundup of lists, resources, and examples&#39; by Beth Kanter&#34;&gt;nonprofit use of Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s certainly exciting to see technology being used in ways that amplify and
extend the impact of movement organizing. I think it&amp;rsquo;s easy, however, to misread
the technology as the &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; of the movement rather than as simply a tool of
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire, for instance, was a society-changing tool. Its revolutionary potential,
however &amp;ndash; cooking food and thus making it more digestible, nutritious, and
lasting &amp;ndash; was only realized through its strategic use.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people, awed by the fire, seem to confuse it with the food. This is
represented most clearly by Jon Pincus, who
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.talesfromthe.net/jon/?p=561&#34; title=&#34;&#39;Twitter *is* a strategy (DRAFT)&#39; by Jon Pincus&#34;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cites a number of campaigns that have used Twitter in successful ways as
evidence of this claim. To me, though, this simply shows that Twitter can be an
effective tool for a given strategy &amp;ndash; but that&amp;rsquo;s not automatically the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this: Why did organizers execute a given campaign on Twitter and not,
say, Identi.ca, FriendFeed, Jaiku or Ping.fm (similar microblogging services) &amp;ndash;
or, for that matter, through Facebook statuses or MySpace bulletins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a tendency to collapse the strategy and the tool &amp;ndash; to attempt to
feast on the fire itself.&lt;/strong&gt; To say, &amp;ldquo;This is what we want to accomplish, and,
hey! there&amp;rsquo;s a tool that does that!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and then equate the tool with the
strategy. But they&amp;rsquo;re still separate thought processes and separate stages in
developing a campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that Twitter was a good tool to use in the cases Jon cited and I
mentioned above. But if organizers limit themselves to seeing Twitter as a
strategy in and of itself &amp;ndash; without considering the strategy &lt;em&gt;apart&lt;/em&gt; from the
tool &amp;ndash; they risk overlooking ways to run a more effective campaign on other
platforms, or augmenting a campaign using multiple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, organizers risk giving supporters feel-good activism that quenches their
desire for social change without actually moving the movement closer to a
concrete goal, or putting any pressure on powerholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The strategy &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; comes first, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; you figure out which tool fits.
The alternative? A forest fire.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political pamphlets, phone trees and jam-the-faxes must have seemed like
strategies in and of themselves when each technology first came out. But a
campaign that didn&amp;rsquo;t begin with a strategy to deploy those tools &lt;em&gt;in an
effective way&lt;/em&gt; wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;real-time coverage&amp;rdquo; use of Twitter, in the style of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXTMob&#34; title=&#34;TXTMob, on Wikipedia&#34;&gt;TXTMob&lt;/a&gt;, can be
effective, and can even form part of the organization of a protest, as it did in
the case of the Olympic torch. But that&amp;rsquo;s not a strategy or even a revolution &amp;ndash;
it&amp;rsquo;s simply street-level news. And in the case of Moldova, the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://frontlineclub.com/blogs/danielbennett/2009/04/the-myth-of-the-moldova-twitter-revolution.html&#34; title=&#34;The myth of the Moldova &#39;Twitter revolution&#39; by Daniel Bennett&#34;&gt;organizing was happening elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact Twitter did not play that big role. The story is quite simple &amp;ndash; young
and active bloggers decided to have a flash-mob action, lighting candles and
&amp;lsquo;mourning Moldova&amp;rsquo; because of Communists victory, which nobody recognized due
to the multiple violations before and during the campaign. They agreed on the
time and place of the action through the network of Moldovan blogs (blogs
aggregator blogosfera.md), and social networks like Facebook/Odnoklassniki,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the most effective &lt;em&gt;tools&lt;/em&gt; to execute the &lt;em&gt;strategy&lt;/em&gt; in question
&amp;ndash; organizing opposition to the regime and making it visible to other Moldovans
&amp;ndash; didn&amp;rsquo;t include Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Evgeny Morozov&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20130114225200/http://neteffect.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/04/07/more_analysis_of_twitters_role_in_moldova&#34; title=&#34;&#39;More analysis of Twitter&#39;s role in Moldova&#39; by Evgeny Morozov&#34;&gt;analysis of Twitter in Moldova&lt;/a&gt;,
he says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s really good that the Moldovan students didn&amp;rsquo;t organize this revolution
via Friendster or LiveJournal (which is still a platform for choice for many
users in Eastern Europe). If they did, they would never have gotten as much
attention from the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perspective is an example of collapsing the strategy and the tool. More
specifically: &lt;strong&gt;Getting attention from the rest of the world is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
automatically the objective of any given social change movement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most social change organizers know this. There are moments when you want to
focus on building awareness and/or getting media attention, but that&amp;rsquo;s often not
the primary focus of the campaign. In the case of the Moldovan students, it
could be that what was most needed was a way to get organizers to identify and
strategize with one another &amp;ndash; in which case Twitter would have been a very poor
(or at least fantastically blunt) tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such perspective is possible only if you think of Twitter as one &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;
tool, perfect for use in some strategies and rather ineffective in others. A
near-religious belief in Twitter (or any technology) &lt;em&gt;as a strategy&lt;/em&gt; leads to a
narrowing of the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; strategy &amp;ndash; getting the world to pay attention becomes
the goal, because, hey, that&amp;rsquo;s what Twitter can be effective at doing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, organizers might have gotten attention from beyond Moldova with a
few dozen Twitterers, but failed at their primary goal of making opposition to
the regime visible &lt;em&gt;to other Moldovans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Alan Rosenblatt
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20130114225200/http://www.kstreetcafe.com/is-twitter-a-strategy-like-come-on/&#34; title=&#34;&#39;Is Twitter a Strategy? Like, Come On!&#39; by Alan Rosenblatt&#34;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;,
different technologies have different ideologies, and tools that are more
&amp;ldquo;inherently democratic&amp;rdquo; like Twitter can be used as tools within a strategy that
empowers people to a much larger degree than one-way media like television. That
doesn&amp;rsquo;t negate the fact that the strategy &amp;ndash; the reason for the campaign itself
&amp;ndash; must be laid out first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Begin with your campaign&amp;rsquo;s strategy &amp;ndash; the food you want to eat. Then
determine which technologies will best cultivate the fire within your supporters
to achieve the social change you seek.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update, April 9, 2009: I misattributed something to Jon Pincus that was
actually written by Evgeny Morozov. It&amp;rsquo;s fixed, above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20090119044552/http://www.soapblox.net/blog&#34;&gt;Soapblox&lt;/a&gt;,
a blogging platform used by many local progressive bloggers &amp;ndash; especially
community blogs &amp;ndash;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2009/01/07/681153/-Soapblox-sites-hacked-Info-gathering-thread&#34; title=&#34;Read the original report on Daily Kos&#34;&gt;collapsed&lt;/a&gt;.
In one fell swoop, hundreds of political activists&amp;rsquo; online communities were
gone, despite the fact that they had been paying for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did one system failure take down such a large network? Because the entire
project was being
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20191123003217/https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2009/01/07/681191/-Why-SoapBlox-Matters&#34; title=&#34;Read about the setup, as described on Daily Kos&#34;&gt;run by one person&lt;/a&gt;,
part-time. These were fairly high-traffic blogs, yet their content was hosted on
Soapblox&amp;rsquo;s own servers, and when it all went down, that data became unavailable.
After first proclaiming the software &amp;ldquo;dead,&amp;rdquo; developer Paul Preston responded to
an outpouring of community support and donations by working to restore the
service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On many lists and other community blogs, discussions have centered on whether it
makes sense for these blogs to stay on Soapblox. &amp;ldquo;The consensus that appears to
have emerged after a fairly short but very wide-ranging discussion is: it may
make sense to transition to another system eventually; for now there is no
readily available alternative,&amp;rdquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120705053736/http://mydd.com/2009/1/10/soapblox-meltdown-and-drupal&#34; title=&#34;Read &#39;Soapblox meltdown and Drupal&#39; on MyDD&#34;&gt;wrote Shai Sachs at MyDD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of those discussions then devolve into &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/&#34;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;!
No, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wordpress.org/&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;!&amp;rdquo; with proponents of each sparring
over how to construct a community blog similar to Soapblox&amp;rsquo;s core features. I
want to refocus the discussion around the underlying issue: &lt;strong&gt;Community blogs
simply run better on open-source software, regardless of the platform.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s true that different systems have different features, and one of
the attractions of Soapblox was that it offered just want community-blog sites
needed out of the box. Setting up community blogs on Drupal or WordPress, both
of which I have pretty extensive experience with, is definitely possible, but
each requires customization &amp;ndash; something many local activists don&amp;rsquo;t have time or
money to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.acquia.com/&#34; title=&#34;Acquia&#34;&gt;are&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mayfirst.coop&#34; title=&#34;May First/People Link&#34;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20090119040137/http://bryght.com/&#34; title=&#34;Bryght&#34;&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt;
that offer &amp;ldquo;hosted&amp;rdquo; versions of open-source software, in the same way that
Soapblox (the company) offered a hosted version of Soapblox (the software). So
why would I recommend the open-source hosts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue here &amp;ndash; and the difference between these open-source hosts and
Soapblox &amp;ndash; is the &lt;strong&gt;gigantic community of open-source developers behind them&lt;/strong&gt;.
Soapblox, like these other companies, helps set up hosting and put a friendly
face on a somewhat complicated piece of software. But there are hundreds of
people working on Drupal that aren&amp;rsquo;t in any way connected to Bryght, or Acquia,
or May First &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s something that all of their customers benefit from:
new features, continually-upgraded plugins and security fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a proprietary system, you get only what the company chooses to put out, and
only what they have time to put out. Paul has since
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20081229235918/http://www.soapblox.net:80/blog/showDiary.do?diaryId=2&#34; title=&#34;Read &#39;Where we stand&#39; on the Soapblox blog&#34;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt;
that &amp;ldquo;SoapBlox needs to be transformed from a proprietary model to one of open
source to help get rid of me alone as the single-point of contact with so much
stuff.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;rsquo;s great, and if Soapblox becomes an open-source project then I&amp;rsquo;d
definitely recommend it along with other open-source platforms. But the point
isn&amp;rsquo;t just to make Paul&amp;rsquo;s life easier, or make him more responsive to customers.
&lt;strong&gt;Open-sourcing Soapblox would make the software, and the blogs it hosts,
better.&lt;/strong&gt; Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me? &lt;em&gt;Information Week&lt;/em&gt; magazine wrote a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.informationweek.com/operating-systems/collaboration-is-at-the-heart-of-open-source-content-management&#34; title=&#34;Read &#39;Collaboration Is At The Heart Of Open Source Content Management&#39; from Information Week&#34;&gt;cover story&lt;/a&gt;
about how businesses are using Drupal and other open-source software, and why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal draws on a strength that&amp;rsquo;s common to other successful open source
efforts: a vibrant community that drives innovation and lets companies tap the
development efforts of thousands of people experimenting with the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since reviving itself, Soapblox has hired some more people, and that&amp;rsquo;s nice, I&amp;rsquo;m
sure, for both Paul and his customers. But the model by which we pay more and
more people to maintain our vitally-important software in locked cages just
seems poor to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even if Bryght/Acquia/May First went out of business tomorrow, virtually all
of its customers could find another vendor to take their system completely
intact and get them up and running in an hour or two.&lt;/strong&gt; Soapblox dies, and their
customers are stuck in the dark &amp;ndash; if they&amp;rsquo;re lucky they might be able to get a
dump of the database and then painstakingly input it into another system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open-source communities as the scaffolding for community blogs just seems like a
no-brainer to me. I certainly understand the limited time people have and the
inertia around a system you already know, but I would hope this might serve as a
wake-up call to explore more robust and sustainable systems, be it Drupal or
WordPress, Joomla or Plone &amp;ndash; or, if Soapblox takes that route, Soapblox itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/01/community-blogs-run-better-open-source-software/&#34;&gt;Community blogs run better on open-source software&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20090217095953/http://genocideintervention.net/&#34;&gt;Genocide Intervention Network&lt;/a&gt;
is an organization that I helped form in college, and where I worked as director
of communications and Internet strategy coordinator from 2004&amp;ndash;2008. The mission
of the organization is to empower members with tools to prevent and stop
genocide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;empowerment&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; is key to the organization&amp;rsquo;s mission, and
undergirds our approach to social networks and social media. GI-Net wants
members who can

and consequently social networking is a key method by which the organization
helps train supporters to speak for themselves, for us, and for an anti-genocide
movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many groups use social networks for &lt;strong&gt;mobilizing&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; getting members out to an
evnt, getting people to sign a petition, getting people to donate for a cause.
GI-Net focuses on &lt;strong&gt;organizing&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; creating an educated constituency of people
who can motivate others.&lt;/p&gt;

  title=&#34;The Facebook Group for the Genocide Intervention Network [dead link]&#34;
  &gt;Facebook&lt;/a
&gt;
in 2005, for example, there were already dozens of groups about the genocide in
Darfur, Sudan. So it was much more about giving supporters tools to take
effective action than it was about convincing people to join our cause. &lt;strong&gt;Social
networks are an integral part of an organizing strategy, because communication
and engagement are what they&amp;rsquo;re all about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;weaving-your-social-web&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Weaving Your Social Web&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dynamics and demographics of each social network are different &amp;ndash; what may
make sense on MySpace could be seen as annoying on Facebook. If you have a
specific niche, you might try focused networks like

&lt;em&gt;(Update, Aug. 18, 2010:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.witness.org/2010/08/update-on-the-hub-and-witness-new-online-strategy/&#34;&gt;The Hub has been retired&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a sociological study of these different kinds of networks, check out the
writings of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/&#34;&gt;danah boyd&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly,
many nonprofit professionals see Facebook as the &amp;ldquo;more interesting&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;more
useful&amp;rdquo; social network as compared to MySpace, and that&amp;rsquo;s largely because,
indeed, Facebook is designed to appeal to the predominant class and educational
backgrounds of these folks. Depending on an organization&amp;rsquo;s constituency,
however, MySpace might actually be a better way to reach your supporters. Don&amp;rsquo;t
decide where to organize online based on which site you or your executive
director personally think is most appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re determining which network(s) to organize on, the key thing to
remember is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be everywhere.&lt;/strong&gt; In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s often better
if you start with just one &amp;ndash; get your bearings, try out some different
approaches, and become thoughtfully engaged with your community of supporters
there. You need to make a commitment to each network you join; there&amp;rsquo;s nothing
worse (or more unprofessional looking) than a clearly-abandoned organizational
profile, where messages go unanswered and spam comments go unmoderated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-media-and-social-networks&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Social Media and Social Networks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media (e.g. YouTube and Flickr) often integrate particularly well with
social networks (e.g. Facebook and MySpace), as a way to help engage members and
heighten interest. Why not simply upload your own images and host your own
videos? The &amp;ldquo;social&amp;rdquo; in social media ensures that, if you post your media with
useful titles, descriptions and keywords, other people may well discover you who
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t otherwise have encountered you &amp;ndash; and you&amp;rsquo;ll draw them further into
your social web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;using-videos-on-myspace&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using Videos on MySpace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we first put our profile up on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20090225024644/http://www.myspace.com/genocideintervention&#34;&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;,
we were getting one or two friend requests a day, and that&amp;rsquo;s not too bad for
just starting off. As soon as we put up a short video about the organization &amp;ndash;
posted via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/genocideintervention&#34;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, in the
hopes of drawing in people from that site as well &amp;ndash; our friend requests went up
to 10&amp;ndash;15 per day. Supporters could embed the videos in their own profiles
themselves. That&amp;rsquo;s the advantage of social media in social networks: &lt;strong&gt;People
are drawn to photos and video, and the nature of social networking allows them
to easily share them with friends.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;keys-to-success-on-social-networks&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keys to Success on Social Networks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about member engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might notice there&amp;rsquo;s only one key: Facilitating conversations &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;among&lt;/em&gt; your supporters. Ultimately, getting an excited base of supporters
begins with having them talk to each other about what they&amp;rsquo;re doing around an
issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s really not a billboard.&lt;/strong&gt; You need to cultivate relationships with your
supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-money-thing&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Money Thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social networks are not going to replace your development director. Even when
you do raise money, it&amp;rsquo;s usually more about member engagement than it is about a
significant revenue stream. GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s experience with Causes, a platform on
Facebook and MySpace, was that &amp;ldquo;fundraisers&amp;rdquo; were actually a great way to give
supporters something concrete to work toward &amp;ndash; but that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a very
significant source of donations. Nonetheless, the social aspect to it ensures
that members who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; participate become even more engaged and are often willing
to help spearhead the next advocacy campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top Cause on Facebook had, as of June 2008, more than 3 million members but
only raised about $50,000; the vast majority of nonprofits using Causes hadn&amp;rsquo;t
raised more than a few hundred dollars. Innovative fundraising campaigns using
social networks may bear fruit financially, but member engagement is almost
always going to be the primary goal in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;let-your-people-speak&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let Your People Speak&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Causes is also a good illustration of another point: &lt;strong&gt;You need to let your
supporters speak for you on social networks.&lt;/strong&gt; GI-Net set up an &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; Cause
on Facebook, but a member-created Cause benefiting us has more than twice the
number of supporters. We could have tried to shut down the unofficial group in
an effort to control our message, but instead we reached out to the creator &amp;ndash;
who was more than willing to send out alerts anyway &amp;ndash; and found ways to engage
our supporters while still recognizing their own creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; of the social experience is the coveted &amp;ldquo;recommendation from a
friend.&amp;rdquo; Forcing your members to send out only board-approved talking points
won&amp;rsquo;t inspire much loyalty, and probably won&amp;rsquo;t be very persuasive to their
friends. &lt;strong&gt;Nonprofits have to be willing to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2008/05/just-what-kind-social-change-are-you-interested&#34; title=&#34;Read &#39;Just what kind of social change are you interested in?&#39;&#34;&gt;lose some of their message&lt;/a&gt;
control in exchange for member loyalty.&lt;/strong&gt; Trust me &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s worth the trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;and-then-listen-to-what-they-say&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;hellip;And Then Listen to What They Say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On our MySpace profile, we have a prominent newsletter-signup form at the top of
the screen. But we don&amp;rsquo;t simply cut-and-paste our blast emails directly to the
MySpace crowd. For one of our MySpace blogs, we said the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you active in your community on anti-genocide issues? Raising money for
civilian protection in Darfur &amp;ndash; educating your neighbors about the mass
atrocities in Burma &amp;ndash; working to pass divestment from Sudan in your state?
Leave us a comment and describe what you&amp;rsquo;re doing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want you in our top friends!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks, we&amp;rsquo;ll be rotating in all of our MySpace friends who are
active on anti-genocide issues into our top friends. You&amp;rsquo;ve been supporting
us, now we want to support you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On MySpace, putting someone in your &amp;ldquo;top friends&amp;rdquo; is a way of showing thanks and
respect, and it was an easy thing to do. We heard from a dozen different local
activists who were all featured, some of whom ended up being key leaders on
future advocacy campaigns. &lt;strong&gt;Show your supporters that you&amp;rsquo;re listening to them,
and they&amp;rsquo;ll reward you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach &amp;ndash; what&amp;rsquo;s sometimes called &amp;ldquo;user-generated content&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; is a
fantastic way to converse with supporters on social networks. Ask people for
their stories, photos, videos or other creative work, and then feature some or
all of that content. You&amp;rsquo;ll end up with more dedicated members who are willing
to take the next step; after having been engaged on a small issue (&amp;ldquo;take a
picture of your fundraiser for Darfur&amp;rdquo;) they&amp;rsquo;ll be willing to lead on a larger
one (&amp;ldquo;help organize a local visit to your member of Congress&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;success-story-1-using-online-student-pressure-to-pass-legislation&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Success Story 1: Using Online Student Pressure to Pass Legislation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, there was an anti-genocide bill that was being held up by a Senate
committee chair. Using Facebook, GI-Net identified and reached out to students
in that senator&amp;rsquo;s home state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of having the students contact the senator directly, we guided the
students in a process of using the website
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opensecrets.org/&#34;&gt;OpenSecrets.org&lt;/a&gt; to determine the senator&amp;rsquo;s top
campaign donors. The students called those donors and asked &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; to contact
the senator and say that standing up against genocide is a moral imperative, and
that the senator should move the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result: Two weeks later, the bill was passed by the committee, was approved
by the full Senate, and eventually was signed into law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;success-story-2-a-photo-petition-puts-students-at-the-heart-of-a-congressional-briefing&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Success Story 2: A Photo Petition Puts Students at the Heart of a Congressional Briefing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s student division, &lt;a href=&#34;https://standnow.org/&#34;&gt;STAND&lt;/a&gt;, initiated a campaign
called &amp;ldquo;Picture a World Without Genocide,&amp;rdquo; in which they encouraged high school
students to submit photos via Facebook and MySpace of their activism on Darfur.
Hundreds of pictures were collected and compiled into a large poster spelling
out the word &amp;ldquo;Darfur.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We presented this poster at a Capitol Hill briefing, in conjunction with a
report we were releasing about congressional action on Darfur. We had prepared
the report, and originally we were going to do a traditional press conference in
which we called out Congress for their inaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to couple the release of this report with this visible manifestation
of student activism, as a way to keep our members engaged. In the weeks
following the event, the numbers of co-sponsors for key legislation increased
substantially &amp;ndash; and &lt;strong&gt;because students had been &amp;ldquo;part of the action,&amp;rdquo; they were
able to claim part of the victory&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, even if no new co-sponsors had signed on, the action still would have
been a great way to activate supporters, so it was really a no-lose campaign for
us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-worldwide-photo-gallery-in-24-hours&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Worldwide Photo Gallery in 24 Hours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When coordinated rallies focusing on Darfur were set up by the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120202182016/http://www.savedarfur.org/&#34;&gt;Save Darfur Coalition&lt;/a&gt;
(of which GI-Net is a part), we encouraged our members to take part &amp;ndash; and take
pictures. Then we had them upload their images to the photosharing site
&lt;a href=&#34;https://flickr.com/photos/genocideintervention&#34;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;, along with a special
tag, or keyword, for that event. Using Flickr&amp;rsquo;s own system, we could then pull
images with that tag onto GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s website in a constantly-updated, rotating
gallery of Darfur activism the day after the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total time on our part? About 15 minutes to write the email to our members, and
10 minutes to put the gallery on our website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;success-story-3-how-social-networks-can-coordinate-a-fundraising-drive&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Success Story 3: How Social Networks Can Coordinate a Fundraising Drive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;STAND&amp;rsquo;s annual &amp;ldquo;DarfurFast&amp;rdquo; encourages students on one day to refrain from one
luxury item, and donate the proceeds to GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s Darfur protection program. We
engage people around the campaign on several different channels, including
Facebook, MySpace, &lt;a href=&#34;https://endgenocide.livejournal.com/&#34;&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/antigenocide&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social networks were a key way to keep supporters engaged &amp;ndash; as well as inviting
friends on campus to take part in the real-world upcoming events. &lt;strong&gt;The key is
that the person-to-person networks already existed in the form of chapters and
campus networks&lt;/strong&gt;; online social networks simply facilitated an easier
invitation to friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we raised more than $500,000 over the course of three years with this event;
2007 saw participation from 450 high schools and 300 colleges. But it&amp;rsquo;s very
unlikely we would have ever raised that kind of money via Facebook et al. alone
&amp;ndash; the online social networks simply supplemented the on-the-ground organizing
we (and campus leaders) had already been doing. In fact, online social networks
are probably &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; strategically useful when the event is offline, allowing
supporters to quickly spread the word well ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that many of these methods worked particularly well
because they centered on students, who are most active on these networks,
generally have easy access to computers and are more likely to have free time.
While GI-Net has a constituency far beyond students alone (and sometimes reaches
those constituencies directly through networks like Eons), you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t
necessarily expect these kinds of returns from everyone. As noted above,
working-class communities, communities of color, folks with less formal
education and various kinds of &amp;ldquo;marginalized&amp;rdquo; groups interact with online social
networks very differently, often because of stronger real-world social networks.
The best organizing strategy activates people through all their social
connections, whether online or offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engaging supporters on social networks is long-term.&lt;/strong&gt; Don&amp;rsquo;t expect
immediate results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It takes effort.&lt;/strong&gt; You need to be willing to communicate, in both
directions, with your supporters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want your members to spread your message, you have to trust them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

conference has gotten off to a great start: nonprofit staffers, activists,
techies and funders gathering to talk about &amp;ndash; and award some money to &amp;ndash; using
technology for social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a couple of blog entries focusing on two of the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080709050029/http://www.netsquared.org/2008/conference/projects/n2y3_featured_projects&#34; title=&#34;View the featured projects&#34;&gt;featured projects&lt;/a&gt;,
KnowMore.org and the Genocide Intervention Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KnowMore.org&amp;rsquo;s proposal is a Firefox extension that just launched, as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080605012715/http://www.netsquared.org/blog/dietrich/knowmore-firefox-extension-debuts-netsquared-2008&#34;&gt;described in the blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension itself acts as a simple lens through which to experience the
web, a lens that brings into focus the business and political practices of
corporations that you purchase from. How it works is fantastically simple:
When you go to a website, Firefox displays a notification bar at the top of
the page, for corporations that have business practices that you might be
concerned about, as well as a link to read more. The extension also displays
visual notifications in search engine results, marking links to corporations
of concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Genocide Intervention Network&amp;rsquo;s proposal is an anti-genocide legislation
tracker and widget system
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080719230742/http://www.netsquared.org/2008/conference/projects/anti-genocide-action-tracker-genocide-scores-every-politician-state-and-university&#34; title=&#34;View the NetSquared proposal&#34;&gt;developed by Ivan Boothe&lt;/a&gt;.
In an interview with GI-NET&amp;rsquo;s Ben Drexler, Aida McArthur asks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AM: What is the main challenge your staff is experiencing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BD: Finding an adequate means of transmitting the actions they are able to
create based upon their analysis. Our traditional means of disseminating this
information is via e-mail or phone contact, but desire a faster means of
communicating to a wider audience to be able to mobilize phone calls from
activists on a faster turnaround basis.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Net2ThinkTank&amp;rdquo; question:
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080724112756/http://www.netsquared.org/blog/britt-bravo/join-net2thinktank-what-if-anything-does-all-clicking-blogging-and-friending-add-end&#34;&gt;Is Online Activism Good for Social Change?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who was quoted in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080923000521/http://www.socialcitizens.org/paper&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Social Citizens&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;
report and has written in the past about technology and social change, my answer
to that question would certainly be &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think the question is significantly complicated in the question from
Allison Fine, author of &amp;ldquo;Social Citizens&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is our tendency to connect only with like-minded people using our online and
on land social networks a good thing for activism or a critical bottleneck to
the effective scaling for causes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put another way I think it could be asked: &lt;strong&gt;Online activism is good for social
change &amp;ndash; but what kind of social change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many nonprofits use social networks and online activism as a way to boost their
membership rolls and donation levels. As I&amp;rsquo;ve
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/blog/2007/10/organizing-rather-mobilizing-using-social-networks-constituency-building&#34;&gt;written before&lt;/a&gt;,
that seems less useful to me than focusing on empowering an effective movement
&amp;ndash; whether or not people donate to your organization or sign up for your
newsletter. This isn&amp;rsquo;t to minimize the challenges everyone faces on how to
support working for social change, both financially and emotionally. But it is
to say that &lt;strong&gt;movements are bigger than any one nonprofit&lt;/strong&gt;. Certainly,
organizations can ignore that and focus on using MySpace to get new email
addresses and Facebook to drum up donations &amp;ndash; but frankly, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that
has a lot to do with social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only when the &lt;em&gt;operational&lt;/em&gt; concerns are placed secondary to &lt;em&gt;social change&lt;/em&gt;
concerns do I see social change really being possible.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s not a secondary
outcome; it has to be the primary concern. And that&amp;rsquo;s true, in my opinion,
whether you&amp;rsquo;re talking about online or offline social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than thirty years ago, sociologists Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward
wrote in the introduction to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.com/books?id=cAlHAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=poor&#43;people%27s&#43;movements&amp;dq=poor&#43;people%27s&#43;movements&amp;pgis=1&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poor People&amp;rsquo;s Movements: Why They Succeed, How They Fail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
(1977):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[D]uring those brief moments when lower-class groups exert some force against
the state, those who call themselves leaders do not usually escalate the
momentum of the people&amp;rsquo;s protests. They do not because they are preoccupied
with trying to build and sustain embryonic formal organizations in the sure
conviction that these organizations will enlarge and become powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, members of the collective INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence
published the scathing
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-revolution-will-not-be-funded&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Revolution Will Not Be Funded: Beyond the Non-Profit Industrial Complex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
which excoriated the nonprofit system &amp;ndash; primarily foundations, but also the
kind of institutionalized dissent Piven and Cloward explored above &amp;ndash; for
perpetuating the social inequity they say they want to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s and &amp;rsquo;80s, rising social inequality helped hasten a breakdown of
both communities and community struggles. (We &amp;ldquo;Millennials&amp;rdquo; of which Fine writes
were, of course, originally termed &amp;ldquo;Reagan Babies.&amp;rdquo;) Poor people&amp;rsquo;s movements
Piven and Cloward explore were co-opted and defused by top-down organizers from
large nonprofits. And family foundations, rooted back in the (first) Gilded Age
and gaining power in the tech booms of the 1990s, helped professionalize the
practice of dissent. Or as Patrick Reinsborough writes in an oft-quoted essay,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joaap.org/1/de_colonizing/index.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;De-Colonizing the Revolutionary Imagination&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as service oriented NGO&amp;rsquo;s have been tapped to fill the voids left by the
state or the market, so have social change NGO&amp;rsquo;s arisen to streamline the
chaotic business of dissent. Let&amp;rsquo;s call this trend NGOism, that terrifyingly
widespread conceit among professional &amp;ldquo;campaigners&amp;rdquo; that social change is a
highly specialized profession best left to experienced strategists,
negotiators and policy wonks. NGOism is the conceit that paid staff will be
enough to save the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some nonprofits, older and more institutionalized, are wary of giving their
members &amp;ldquo;control&amp;rdquo; of their &amp;ldquo;message&amp;rdquo; in the realm of social networks and social
media. Mostly, I think that&amp;rsquo;s nothing more than a fear of losing power. When you
think you know how to change the world, it can be hard for some people to want
to involve others &amp;ndash; or give anyone else the credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is that this time around, there&amp;rsquo;s a significantly higher
ability for activists to self-organize. &lt;strong&gt;The message to nonprofits from
activists in the past few years seems pretty clear: Stand in our way, and we&amp;rsquo;ll
just go around you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2006 student walkouts for immigrant rights
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/28/AR2006032800982.html&#34;&gt;spread through MySpace without any &amp;ldquo;sponsoring&amp;rdquo; organization&lt;/a&gt;.
As I explained in a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/forumone/ivan-boothe-v2&#34;&gt;presentation on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;,
when the Genocide Intervention Network first arrived on the scene, we found
dozens of existing groups and networks already active &amp;ndash; our objective was
simply to connect them and provide them with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20071013185105/http://www.1800genocide.com/&#34;&gt;effective&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080708201835/http://www.darfurscores.org/&#34;&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt;
for action. A participant in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14586563&#34;&gt;protests over the Jena Six&lt;/a&gt;
said, &amp;ldquo;I am so disappointed with the media right now. I live in Connecticut and
I never even heard of this. Honestly if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for Facebook, I still wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the question really goes to the nonprofits and other groups using social
networks and social media:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of social change do you want?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you willing to help facilitate even if you don&amp;rsquo;t get credit, coverage,
or donations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; nonprofits can&amp;rsquo;t work for social change through
technology, or that only unsupported volunteers can really make things better &amp;ndash;
as Reinsborough puts it in the corollary to the comment above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that corporate campaigns and winning concessions is merely
&amp;ldquo;reformist&amp;rdquo; and therefore not important. The simplistic dichotomy of reform
versus revolution often hides the privilege of &amp;ldquo;radicals&amp;rdquo; who have the luxury
of refusing concessions when it&amp;rsquo;s not their community or ecosystem that is on
the chopping block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more important distinction is which direction is the concession moving
towards? Is it a concession that releases pressure on the system and thereby
legitimizes illegitimate authority? Or is it a concession that teaches people
a lesson about grassroots power building and therefore brings us closer to
systemic social change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not as worried about whether, as Fine asks, the &amp;ldquo;tendency to connect only
with like-minded people&amp;rdquo; puts limitations on what can be achieved. Most social
change movements, including the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20160709093103/http://tinyurl.com/4xaffs&#34; title=&#34;The Origins of the Civil Rights Movement: Black Communities Organizing for Social Change, by Aldon D. Morris&#34;&gt;US civil rights movement&lt;/a&gt;,
are grounded in those sorts of communities, what&amp;rsquo;s referred to as &amp;ldquo;affective
ties.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a larger question of the technology gap &amp;ndash; social movements in
general might not be as confined by co-optation like Piven and Cloward describe,
but &lt;strong&gt;poor people&amp;rsquo;s movements without access or usable knowledge of such
technology are still vulnerable to having their goals and struggles appropriated
by the more powerful&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as danah boyd explores in her fascinating research, these issues are
played out in social networks themselves. &amp;ldquo;The division around MySpace and
Facebook is just another way in which technology is mirroring societal values,&amp;rdquo;
she writes in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ClassDivisions.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Viewing American class divisions through Facebook and MySpace.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think there are gaps in &lt;strong&gt;access, in knowledge, and in audience&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; many
nonprofits I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to seem to be more excited about organizing on Facebook
for instance, because it seems more &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;easy.&amp;rdquo; But it may seem that
way simply because it aligns with the class and social habits of people who
staff nonprofits &amp;ndash; and as boyd documents, many subaltern communities of people
(for whom nonprofits are often trying to speak) tend to use MySpace to a greater
extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080511015655/http://unite.blogcatalog.com/&#34;&gt;Bloggers Unite for Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;
(Day). The organizers assert that bloggers can &amp;ldquo;use their space to make the
world a better place.&amp;rdquo; And clearly, given what I do, I think there is a
potential for social networks and social media to highlight and organize and
empower. But I don&amp;rsquo;t think we can get too far ahead of ourselves, and I think we
need to be clear about just what it is we&amp;rsquo;re reaching for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working for social change means being committed to examining inequality and
injustice in our world, and it&amp;rsquo;s simply na&amp;iuml;ve to think that those dynamics don&amp;rsquo;t
affect the very way our organizations &amp;ndash; and our notions of social change &amp;ndash; are
structured.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2008/05/just-what-kind-social-change-are-you-interested/&#34;&gt;Just what kind of social change are you interested in?&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the Genocide Intervention Network was honored to be nominated by the
NetSquared community as a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080308231814/http://www.netsquared.org/2008/conference&#34;&gt;2008 Featured Project&lt;/a&gt;
for our proposal to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080719230742/http://www.netsquared.org/2008/conference/projects/anti-genocide-action-tracker-genocide-scores-every-politician-state-and-university&#34;&gt;upgrade and extend the DarfurScores.org website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Genocide Intervention Network seeks to create a new website, modeled on
our successful Darfur congressional scorecard,
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080708201835/http://www.darfurscores.org/&#34;&gt;DarfurScores.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,
tentatively named GenocideScores.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Our
current plan for the site &amp;ndash; which could change as we explore different options
and hear feedback from our members &amp;ndash; has four main components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collecting together anti-genocide data&lt;/strong&gt;, not only on Darfur but on each of
our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080614191436/http://www.genocideintervention.net:80/educate/crisis/overview&#34;&gt;areas of concern&lt;/a&gt;.
Instead of being limited to only legislative records, each state would list
its status on other anti-genocide initiatives like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080724095105/http://sudandivestment.org/&#34;&gt;Sudan divestment&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080320063747/http://www.teachagainstgenocide.org:80/&#34;&gt;genocide education&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide clear illustrations of legislative status.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of just hearing
about a bill when a member of Congress does (or doesn&amp;rsquo;t) vote for it, we&amp;rsquo;ll be
tracking bills as they move through each chamber.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-index a bill&amp;rsquo;s status with a member&amp;rsquo;s location.&lt;/strong&gt; When the latest bill
on genocide prevention is up for a vote, anti-genocide activists whose members
of Congress represent key votes on the legislation will be able to receive
automatic alerts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide embeddable badges or widgets for activists to place on their
profiles, blogs or websites.&lt;/strong&gt; At a glance, both you and visitors to your
website, blog or social networking profile will be able to see how your state
and legislators are doing on the question of genocide. And when urgent action
is needed, these badges will be automatically updated with a special link to
take action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, we want your feedback. If you have a chance,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080719230742/http://www.netsquared.org/2008/conference/projects/anti-genocide-action-tracker-genocide-scores-every-politician-state-and-university&#34;&gt;read through our proposal for DarfurScores.org&lt;/a&gt;
and leave a comment&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; tell us what you like, what you think could be changed,
what we&amp;rsquo;re overlooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that this is all about our core mission: &lt;strong&gt;empowering individuals and
communities with the tools to prevent and stop genocide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this project will result in a valuable new tool, and we&amp;rsquo;d love to have
your input!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2008/03/genocide-intervention-network-nominated-netsquared-mashup-award/&#34;&gt;Genocide Intervention Network nominated for NetSquared mashup award&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

workshop in Providence, Rhode Island. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/&#34;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; is a
free, open-source content management system that allows non-technical users to
update your site and is capable of powering blogs, community sites,
action-oriented campaigns and social networks along the lines of MySpace and
Facebook. Lullabot, a Drupal development firm that involved in much of the
Drupal development, has a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lullabot.com/articles/how-drupal-will-save-the-world&#34;&gt;keen interest in Drupal for nonprofits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In return for NetSquared&amp;rsquo;s generosity, I wanted to post some tips for nonprofits
thinking about using Drupal for their sites. I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that, under most
circumstances, Drupal can be a powerful resource for online advocacy and social
change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, I have built four full-fledged sites with Drupal for the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080804233456/http://www.genocideintervention.net/&#34;&gt;Genocide Intervention Network&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

(v4.7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070208211701/http://www.timetoprotect.org/&#34;&gt;Time to Protect&lt;/a&gt;

  title=&#34;http://www.powertoprotect.org [dead link]&#34;
  &gt;Power to Protect&lt;/a
&gt; (v4.6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080804233456/http://www.genocideintervention.net/&#34;&gt;main site&lt;/a&gt;
was also developed in Drupal (v4.7) by an outside firm, as was GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s student
site, &lt;a href=&#34;https://standnow.org/&#34;&gt;STAND&lt;/a&gt; (v4.7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20170312021724/http://www.quixoticlife.net/&#34;&gt;personal site&lt;/a&gt;
is in Drupal (v5) and I&amp;rsquo;m working on releasing an e-commerce site and a
community events site in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have a working knowledge of basic PHP, on which Drupal is based, my
work primarily is in HTML and CSS &amp;ndash; for the majority of things our sites need
to do, it&amp;rsquo;s mainly a matter of finding the right modules (plugins) and then
themeing (designing) the site to look the way we want. By and large you don&amp;rsquo;t
need to have a lot of programming knowledge to create effective sites in Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-to-use-drupal----and-when-not-to-use-it&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When to Use Drupal &amp;ndash; and When Not to Use it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drupal has a number of strengths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you understand the terminology and basic structure of Drupal, it&amp;rsquo;s easy
to set up sites relatively quickly, with advanced functionality simply
&amp;ldquo;dropped in&amp;rdquo; by way of modules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drupal is relatively easy to theme, especially in version 5 and even more so
in the upcoming version 6 (likely to be released in early 2008).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drupal is extremely search-engine friendly, helping get your site to the top
of search engine lists with minimal effort. With a few tweaks and additional
modules, it can be even more effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drupal is relatively scalable, able to power large sites as well as small. For
very high-traffic sites, this will take some tweaking of the server settings,
but this is true for pretty much any content management system (CMS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s free! More importantly, it has a large, robust community of developers
regularly updating both its core features and plug-in modules &amp;ndash; also for
free! And when you can&amp;rsquo;t swing the free-software cost &amp;ndash; staff time &amp;ndash; there
are plenty of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/drupal-services&#34;&gt;Drupal developers&lt;/a&gt; out
there. For nonprofits looking to &amp;ldquo;act out&amp;rdquo; social change, Drupal is a welcome
addition to for-profit corporations upon which you have to depend for any
updates or bug fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because it&amp;rsquo;s open-source, Drupal won&amp;rsquo;t lock you in to a proprietary system
that mangles your data or makes it difficult to switch to another CMS in the
future. Additionally, it&amp;rsquo;s open nature allows for more frequent integration
with other software and web services &amp;ndash; everything from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/&#34;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.salesforce.com/&#34;&gt;Salesforce&lt;/a&gt;, with rumors of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080806144433/http://www2.democracyinaction.org/&#34;&gt;Democracy in Action&lt;/a&gt;
on the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of special note, Drupal has tight integration with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://civicrm.org/&#34;&gt;CiviCRM&lt;/a&gt; and equally free, open-source contact
relationship manager (also available for the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joomla.org/&#34;&gt;Joomla CMS&lt;/a&gt;). If you opt to use CiviCRM as your CRM
for donors or members, you can aggregate useful data like donations through
the website, membership dues, attendance at events, subscriptions to mailing
lists and participation in local groups, as well as the usual searching,
sorting and categorizing of contacts available in any CRM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For you geeks out there, it uses standards compliant (at least in core)
semantic code and is built on the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller&#34;&gt;MVC&lt;/a&gt;
model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many prominent sites, both commercial and nonprofit, have been built on Drupal,
including
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080801192132/http://www.mtv.co.uk/&#34;&gt;MTV.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080805060144/http://dodd.senate.gov/&#34;&gt;Sen. Chris Dodd&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080108234632/http://www.theonion.com/content/index&#34;&gt;The Onion&lt;/a&gt;
and NetSquared itself
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080805075701/http://www.netsquared.org/&#34;&gt;see a full list&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorites, just recently released, is WITNESS&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20071220024321/http://hub.witness.org/&#34;&gt;The Hub&lt;/a&gt;,
built by the fine folks at &lt;a href=&#34;https://civicactions.com/&#34;&gt;CivicActions&lt;/a&gt;. (The Hub
was also a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070817032657/http://www.netsquared.org/projects/proposals/hub&#34;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt;
for the 2007 NetSquared Conference.) I think The Hub really shows the potential
for social change that Drupal-powered sites can accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When might you not want to use Drupal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those completely new to Drupal, it can have a significant learning curve.
We&amp;rsquo;re not talking Photoshop here, but much of the terminology and structure of
the site can be unfamiliar to new users, even those familiar with other CMSes.
If you need a hot website tomorrow and can&amp;rsquo;t spring for a paid developer, it
might make more sense to go with a CMS you already know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drupal is an excellent platform for blogs, and allows you to build in a lot of
community and social-networking features that can strengthen your blog&amp;rsquo;s
appeal. However, &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, another free open-source
software, is specifically oriented toward blogs. The learning curve is
significantly less, and it&amp;rsquo;s somewhat easier to theme (design). If you&amp;rsquo;re
primarily a designer and you want a straightforward blog site without having
to ever see a line of PHP code, WordPress may well be a better option. Like
Drupal, it has an excellent community of developers and contributers, and many
of its plugins can also stretch its capabilities to encompass
social-networking-oriented functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you absolutely need a website tomorrow &amp;ndash; a simple blog or &amp;ldquo;brochureware&amp;rdquo;
site giving the basics of a new campaign and a place to post updates and press
releases, your best bet may be &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joomla.org/&#34;&gt;Joomla&lt;/a&gt;. Like Drupal
and WordPress, it&amp;rsquo;s free, open-source and has lots of developers, many of them
involved in nonprofits and advocacy campaigns. It is somewhat harder to design
to not look like &amp;ldquo;a Joomla site&amp;rdquo; but there&amp;rsquo;s no question that it&amp;rsquo;s faster to
set up and publish a simple website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free software is great and all, but if you have no budget and no design or
programming resources in-house, you may want to stick with that commercial CMS
you know &amp;ndash; or even Dreamweaver or FrontPage sites. The cost of free software
is the development time, and that isn&amp;rsquo;t an insignificant concern. If you&amp;rsquo;re
planning a big campaign and have a budget or in-house developers, I highly
recommend one of the open-source CMSes because of all of the strengths
mentioned above (and particularly that they won&amp;rsquo;t lock you into some horrible
proprietary code nightmare). But not every nonprofit will have that luxury,
and you should carefully consider if you have the money or staff time to build
a site from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Above, I mentioned that many Drupal modules offer integration with other
software and web services. This is true, but not for every piece of software
out there, and not always as robustly as you might like. In particular, if you
have a lot of tight integration needs and already have another piece hosted
with another service &amp;ndash; a donor database or an online action suite, for
instance &amp;ndash; it may make sense to build your website using their own CMS to
allow for the tightest possible integration. You&amp;rsquo;ll give up some of the cool
Drupal functionality and customization possibilities, but when it comes time
to run those end-year reports, you just push a button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drupal is built by volunteers. Some of them are paid web developers who
voluntarily contribute their work back to the Drupal community. But nothing is
guaranteed &amp;ndash; that module you depend on might have a bug that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get
fixed for six months. There are ways to help guard against this &amp;ndash; for
instance, by sticking to modules
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080805011707/http://www.lullabot.com/audiocast/drupal_podcast_no_40_top_40_projects&#34;&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt;

and checking to see how often past releases have come out, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely
something to consider. In all of the sites I&amp;rsquo;ve built Drupal on, only one
mission-critical item has ever had a serious bug that took a couple of months
to get addressed. That said, if you do have developers on hand or can pay
others, Drupal&amp;rsquo;s open-source nature makes it easy to find and squash the bugs
yourself as they occur &amp;ndash; no waiting on Kintera or Convio to get around to
fixing your pet peeve with the software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;drupal-resources-for-nonprofits&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Drupal Resources for Nonprofits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.drupal.org/drupal-for-good&#34;&gt;Drupal for Good&lt;/a&gt; is the primary
Drupal-centered site for nonprofit and charitable discussions. (For the
mischievous, there&amp;rsquo;s also
&lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.drupal.org/drupal-for-evil&#34;&gt;Drupal for Evil&lt;/a&gt;.) There are plenty
of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.drupal.org/og/all?filter0=&amp;filter1=141&amp;filter2=**ALL**&#34;&gt;geographically-based Drupal groups&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;ndash; see if there&amp;rsquo;s one near you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s lots of general Drupal support out there, including the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080629032329/http://drupal.org/handbooks&#34;&gt;handbook documentation&lt;/a&gt;,

and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/planet&#34;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;. (If you have questions about a
specific module, the best practice is to go to that module&amp;rsquo;s project page on
Drupal and post an issue &amp;ndash; among other things, it&amp;rsquo;s far more likely your
questions or concerns will be answered than if you post on the general forums!)
There are also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/books&#34;&gt;books on Drupal&lt;/a&gt; as well as
fee-based training from groups like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080804225909/http://www.lullabot.com/training&#34;&gt;Lullabot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070920094210/http://www.netsquared.org/&#34;&gt;NetSquared&lt;/a&gt;
asks,

&lt;p&gt;For the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080710032847/http://www.genocideintervention.net/&#34;&gt;Genocide Intervention Network&lt;/a&gt;,
which is the organization I&amp;rsquo;m involved with that has been most active in social
networking, involvement in the &amp;ldquo;social web&amp;rdquo; is really an outgrowth of our entire
mission: To form the first anti-genocide constituency, and to empower our
members with the tools to prevent and stop genocide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words &amp;ldquo;constituency&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;empower&amp;rdquo; are key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not simply looking for a mailing list or an ATM &amp;ndash; we want an educated,
active movement of people interested in preventing and stopping genocide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our members need to be able to think for themselves on the issue &amp;ndash; to hold
events in their communities, motivate others to take action, press their elected
representatives to take stand &amp;ndash; not to simply be another name on a list, but to
be a hub in an ever-expanding network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really the principle behind the social web:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cluetrain.com/book/95-theses.html&#34;&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s all about conversations&lt;/a&gt;. And
for us, conversations are the perfect way to build a vibrant, effective
movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When GI-Net began, we were primary student-oriented, and so organizing in places
like Facebook was really a necessity. But as we grew, it became clear that
focusing on these types of networks, in which we were able to supply members
with knowledge but they were also empowered to speak for themselves, could be a
powerful way to grow our impact exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, effective social movements have

aside, twenty-first century movements won&amp;rsquo;t be any different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080618234425/http://www.idealware.org/articles/social_networking_genocide.php&#34;&gt;first started writing about this&lt;/a&gt;,
however, I explained an important requirement for engagement in the social web
to succeed &amp;ndash; and this is still true for us today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a mentality shift required to fully engage with social networking and
community content sites: sometimes, you have to let go. It&amp;rsquo;s true that someone
could start posting pictures on Flickr of irrelevant things and tag them
&amp;ldquo;antigenocide,&amp;rdquo; or that some of our biggest fans hosting the YouTube video on
MySpace might have profiles that would make some of our donors cringe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even more significantly, it&amp;rsquo;s possible that some of the people who
encounter us on these sites never make it to our main website, never sign up
for a newsletter, never complete an action, and never make a donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For us, it goes back to our mission: to empower our members to prevent and
stop genocide, and in so doing, to create an educated anti-genocide
constituency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we do, of course, want to increase our membership rolls and make
ever-larger donations to civilian protection, in some respects it&amp;rsquo;s not always
necessary for people to perform every anti-genocide action through our
organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our videos or emails or profiles get people talking more substantially
about genocide &amp;ndash; and the concrete ways in which they can actually prevent and
stop genocide &amp;ndash; then in some sense whether they end up on our mailing list is
somewhat beside the point. Through their knowledge they will engage others,
and ultimately enhance the anti-genocide movement we&amp;rsquo;re helping to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080621134439/http://www.personaldemocracy.com/node/1116&#34;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt;
of GI-Net and Catalyst Campaigns, Joshua Levy describes this approach as
&amp;ldquo;similar to bottom-up, open-source collaborative projects,&amp;rdquo; and I think that&amp;rsquo;s
exactly right. Our organization is engaged in a collaborative project with our
members, and while we may have particular resources or acquired expertise, it&amp;rsquo;s
really their activism and passion that will build and drive the movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it all comes down to is that we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on organizing people into a
permanent anti-genocide movement (and much of that happens in a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080516033252/http://www.idealware.org/articles/participatory_tools.php&#34;&gt;decentralized, self-organized&lt;/a&gt;
sort of way) rather than simply mobilizing people for a particular event or
campaign and then sending them home. If you just need bodies at a rally, names
on a petition or donations in your coffers, &lt;strong&gt;mobilizing&lt;/strong&gt; through traditional
means will work great. But if you need an active, educated and effective
movement, &lt;strong&gt;organizing&lt;/strong&gt; through social webs has the potential to create much
more lasting change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to highlight a small initiative the Genocide Intervention Network
sent out today using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080701112343/http://collactive.com/&#34;&gt;Collactive&lt;/a&gt;,
a web firm that helps organizations use their network of members to promote news
stories and websites to larger audiences. You can see our action in the message
below, or by going to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a
  data-dead-link=&#34;http://www.GenocideIntervention.net/OneMinute&#34;
  href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/dead-link/&#34;
  title=&#34;http://www.GenocideIntervention.net/OneMinute [dead link]&#34;
  &gt;GenocideIntervention.net/OneMinute&lt;/a
&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this action, we used Collactive twice to promote particular op-eds (one
in the &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080303224037/http://www.collactive.com/success_ginet.html&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s a writeup&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;ndash; and one in the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt;) that aligned with our positions on how to stop
genocide in Darfur. We had our members email the articles, via Collactive (which
steps you through the process), and quickly raised them to the &amp;ldquo;most emailed&amp;rdquo;
spot on the home page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt; article, which was about the need for divestment
from Sudan, we had our members specifically email the article to a
vice-president at Fidelity, which has a lot of investments in Sudan-linked
business firms. So in that case, we got a two-for-one &amp;ndash; both raising awareness
of the issue and flooding a decisionmaker with an important column. You can read
more about these successes in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070702053010/http://genocideintervention.net/members/newsletter/index.php/2007-05/29/&#34;&gt;our recent supporter newsletter&lt;/a&gt;
(see &amp;ldquo;The One Minute Action&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;

    
      
        
        &lt;source srcset=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2007/07/one-minute-1-800-genocide/1800genocide.avif %!s(&lt;nil&gt;)&#34; type=&#34;image/avif&#34;&gt;

        title=&#34; &#34;
      
    /&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we are asking our members to vote up an article on our
anti-genocide hotline,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070210072326/http://www.1800genocide.com/&#34;&gt;1-800-GENOCIDE&lt;/a&gt;,
on the social bookmarking website Reddit. We just sent this out a few hours ago,
so things are still developing. Collactive also has ways to focus your network&amp;rsquo;s
power on YouTube videos, Digg articles and specific blog entries (for instance,
to flood a blog with positive or negative comments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been pretty happy with Collactive so far; if anyone has any questions
about these campaigns I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to relate our experiences. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious
about the 1-800-GENOCIDE initiative &amp;ndash; which guides callers through the process
of leaving messages for elected officials &amp;ndash; you can

&lt;p&gt;And, if you get a chance, please

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Although these two panels were held separately at the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070308071728/http://www.nten.org/ntc&#34;&gt;Nonprofit Technology Conference 2007&lt;/a&gt;,
I thought that they related so well that I&amp;rsquo;d present them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging the Power of Participatory Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

and resources
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.epolitics.com/2007/04/05/resources-for-n-ten-panel-on-socialparticipatory-media/&#34;&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070701104529/http://www.echoditto.com/&#34;&gt;EchoDitto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Future of Online Outreach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marty Kearns and Ruby Sinreich,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070701171633/http://www.greenmediatoolshed.org/&#34;&gt;Green Media Toolshed&lt;/a&gt;
(closely-related
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20220128034821/https://activist.blogs.com/networkcentricadvocacypaper.pdf&#34;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt;
available on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080124154123/http://www.netcentriccampaigns.org/&#34;&gt;Netcentric Campaigns&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participatory media is a campaign that utilizes content created by the
users/members/visitors of the campaign &amp;ndash; and in may cases, this creation of
content is the campaign itself. &lt;strong&gt;Colin&lt;/strong&gt; began by offering an example of a
participatory-media approach that had backfired for a corporation, the
anti-Chevy
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070531074727/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CVezHDxFuw&#34;&gt;Chevy Tahoe ad&lt;/a&gt;.
(This ad campaign would also show up in &lt;strong&gt;Marty&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s presentation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colin pointed out that Chevy had decided to leave the ads online because they
had the effect of driving lots of traffic to the website &amp;ndash; thus turning a
negative backlash into a positive result. In his presentation, however, Marty
said there had been a significant drop in sales of the Tahoe the next quarter &amp;ndash;
possibly due to the rise in gas prices, but possibly also due to this negative
publicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After recommending that campaigns engage in participatory media for the simple
reason that your users are doing it anyway (giving the example of the
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h3G-lMZxjo&#34;&gt;vote different&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; video), Colin
outlined the basic motivations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;engagement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leveraging collective intelligence (Marty might call this being
network-centric)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publicity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because they&amp;rsquo;re there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colin pointed out that email discussion lists and fora were a basic form of
user-generated content. Beyond that lay blogs, then video and photographs,
altered images, stories, social networking projects and &amp;ldquo;ideas&amp;rdquo; themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several levels of engagement possible with participatory media:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;observation (one-way, receiving information)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interaction (responding with information, as in a blog comment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contribution (creating information, as in posting a blog)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;solicitation (asking others to create information in response to yours, as in
a video response or a contest)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prime example of participatory media that Colin gave was Late Night with Conan
O&amp;rsquo;Brien&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070705204729/http://www.hornymanatee.com/&#34;&gt;HornyManatee.com&lt;/a&gt;.
The site solicits hot manatee action from its users,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070127151216/http://www.hornymanatee.com:80/fan_art/8017.shtml&#34;&gt;to great effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael&lt;/strong&gt; then took the helm, demonstrating two participatory media campaigns
EchoDitto had worked on (which coincidentally both
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20071028185218/http://www.echoditto.com/node/1063&#34;&gt;won awards&lt;/a&gt;):
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070719052759/http://www.sinceslicedbread.com/&#34;&gt;Since Sliced Bread&lt;/a&gt;
and the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070630001236/http://www.pearlharborstories.org/&#34;&gt;Pearl Harbor Survivors Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Survivors Project, Michael talked about the strategizing they had done
in order to collect the stories of the several-hundred remaining survivors of
the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. They had set up a toll-free number so that
technologically-challenged seniors wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to interface with the website,
but to their surprise that was the primary mode of submission. In another twist,
they established a MySpace profile not expecting much response from a youthful
crowd, but soon went on to find 20,000 friend requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael pointed out that the nature of participatory media was still new enough
that it is able to earn media for the organization &amp;ndash; the Survivors Project
really took off after a feature in Parade. The very existence of the campaign
was a news story, in a way a traditional museum-style exhibit on Pearl Harbor
would not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Since Sliced Bread, Michael explained that it was an attempt by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://seiu.org/&#34;&gt;SEIU&lt;/a&gt; president Andy Stern to solicit ideas directly from
workers, because he felt like DC lobbyists and consultants working on labor
issues weren&amp;rsquo;t concerned with the real issues facing his union members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users were thus invited to submit their best ideas Since Sliced Bread, with the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070719053813/http://www.sinceslicedbread.com/idea/9602&#34;&gt;winner&lt;/a&gt;
receiving a prize of $100,000 and runners-up receiving money as well. The
project had what Michael called &amp;ldquo;a panel of sort-of celebrities&amp;rdquo; which narrowed
the tens-of-thousands of entries to a slate of 21 finalists. The community then
voted on the winners from those 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael talked about the issues confronted by the team when losers in the
contest turned against the site &amp;ndash; a much higher volume of nasty blog comments,
to the point that the blog became de-emphasized on the site to try to remove the
flashpoint. The site also generated some serious victories as well, including
the winning project going on to being approved by voters in a Washington state
ballot initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the question-and-answer period, numerous participatory media campaigns were
offered, including the March of Dimes&#39;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070717211439/http://www.shareyourstory.org/&#34;&gt;Share Your Story&lt;/a&gt;
and the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070610082243/http://picturethecure.ca/&#34;&gt;Picture the Cure&lt;/a&gt;
(cached copy, site seems down) initiative for the Canadian Cancer Society.
&lt;strong&gt;Alan Rosenblatt&lt;/strong&gt; said
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070706210219/http://www.care2.com/&#34;&gt;Care2&lt;/a&gt; had
done a study demonstrating that people who participated in discussion fora were
74% more likely to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-to-the-second-session&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On to the second session!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marty&lt;/strong&gt; began by making the argument that the differences in social networks
(connections) today &amp;ndash; aptly covered by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20081205054343/netsquared.org/blog/britt-bravo/notes-ntc-keynote-david-weinberger&#34;&gt;David Weinberger&lt;/a&gt;
earlier in the day &amp;ndash; should necessarily change the way we go about social
organizing. It is not as much about building individual leadership or
organizational capacity, he said, but about making strong and effective
connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, what would your organization do with 10,000 people for ten
minutes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people today are under a barrage of information. When the FCC&amp;rsquo;s
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.donotcall.gov/&#34;&gt;Do Not Call&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; list was launched, 50 million people
signed up in just a few weeks &amp;ndash; without any advertising whatsoever. These
people have &amp;ldquo;walked away from the current models of civic engagement.&amp;rdquo; They
don&amp;rsquo;t sign up for email lists because they&amp;rsquo;re afraid of ever getting off &amp;ndash; a
barrier to exit becomes a barrier to entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network-centric advocacy focuses not only on the individual or organization, but
more importantly on the network &amp;ldquo;as a mechanism for exerting influence.&amp;rdquo; Recent
political examples of this include the Gray Davis recall campaign, the Howard
Dean presidential campaign, and the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070708232229/http://www.networkforjustice.org/partners/New_Yorkers_Against_The_Death_Penalty&#34;&gt;Network for Justice Against the Death Penalty&lt;/a&gt;
campaign, which used an innovative evite.com-style model for encouraging people
to encourage their friends to sign up (and publicly display the results). A more
visual example is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070714124801/http://forwardtrack.eyebeamresearch.org/&#34;&gt;ForwardTrack&lt;/a&gt;,
recently deployed by the Oxygen network in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070716232054/http://speakup.oxygen.com/campaigns/womensrights/&#34;&gt;Oh! Speakup!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong network depends on five key components, according to Marty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;strong social ties&lt;/em&gt; that become a &amp;ldquo;tangible, measured and carefully
cultivated strategic asset&amp;rdquo; for organizers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;a common story&lt;/em&gt; that allows the core actors to understand each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;a communications grid&lt;/em&gt; that allows for one-to-one, one-to-many and
many-to-many conversations, including self-segmentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;shared resources&lt;/em&gt; for coordinated tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;clarity of purpose&lt;/em&gt; and given the context to refine this purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What networks are particularly good at are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;connecting (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ebay.com/&#34;&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sequencing (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETI@home&#34;&gt;SETI@Home&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;synchronizing (&lt;a href=&#34;https://smartmobs.com/book-summary/&#34;&gt;flash mobs&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distributing (viral news)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional examples given were MoveOn.org&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070709151254/http://bushin30seconds.org/&#34;&gt;Bush in 30 Seconds&lt;/a&gt;
and the unaffiliated
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070625065450/http://www.congressin30seconds.com/&#34;&gt;Congress in 30 Seconds&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;ndash; both participatory media campaigns!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session closed with time for people to meet in small groups and discuss
network-centric advocacy in the context of their own organizaitons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with a quote from Marty: &amp;ldquo;Networks are
leader&lt;em&gt;ful&lt;/em&gt; and boss&lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2007/04/notes-ntc-participatory-media-future-online-outreach/&#34;&gt;Notes from NTC: Participatory media and the future of online outreach&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

efforts in &amp;ldquo;social networking&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; things like MySpace, Facebook, Flickr and
del.icio.us &amp;ndash; have been attracting a fair amount of attention. I was invited to
write guest posts for the

that I wrote as an introduction to the NetSquared national conference last May

  &gt;PDF of the brochure&lt;/a
&gt;
distributed to attendees).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Joshua Levy at Personal Democracy Forum posts the
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070717032434/http://www.personaldemocracy.com/node/1116&#34;&gt;rules for using MySpace&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
derived from interviews with me and with Scott Goodstein, another online
organizer who has done some amazing work with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070709102431/http://www.myspace.com/savetheinternet&#34;&gt;Save the Internet&lt;/a&gt;,

and the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070708173159/http://www.militaryfreezone.org/&#34;&gt;Military Free Zone&lt;/a&gt;.
(Scott was also the person who originally contacted GI-Net about collaborating
with the band &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.anti-flag.com/&#34;&gt;Anti-Flag&lt;/a&gt; on a Darfur essay included
in their newest album.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I have been emphasizing in all of these presentations and interviews
has been the idea of &lt;strong&gt;using social networking as a &amp;ldquo;bottom-up&amp;rdquo; way of online
mobilization&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; in the words of GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s mission, &amp;ldquo;empowering individuals and
communities with the tools&amp;rdquo; to effect change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salient quote from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070717032434/http://www.personaldemocracy.com/node/1116&#34;&gt;Joshua&amp;rsquo;s article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering concrete ideas for how to solve a seemingly insurmountable problem
can give people a sense that they, as individuals, have a stake in an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Genocide Intervention Network links to a list of &amp;ldquo;ten things you can do to
stop genocide.&amp;rdquo; Ivan Boothe argues that these steps, broken down into easily
digestible chunks, give people an easy way to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although they also link to the Genocide Intervention Network&amp;rsquo;s main web site,
that isn&amp;rsquo;t always the point. &amp;ldquo;A number of these steps aren&amp;rsquo;t even within our
organization,&amp;rdquo; Boothe says. This sort of advocacy is similar to bottom-up,
open-source collaborative projects like Wikipedia, in which no one group has
proprietary ownership over an idea or a product; instead, the goal is a
constant generation of awareness and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A MySpace page, says Boothe, isn&amp;rsquo;t simply an advertisement for an
organization, &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s a tool for mobilizing people for different kinds of
action.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t by any means consider myself an expert (personally I find myself less
interested in MySpace than you might expect &amp;ndash; but then again I&amp;rsquo;m a techie who
hates cell phones, so maybe that&amp;rsquo;s not a surprise) but I do think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot
to be accomplished in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think organizations just have to stay focused on empowering their members
rather than simply advertising to them, and really being willing engaging them
in a constructive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the
&lt;a
  data-dead-link=&#34;http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/79084/myspace_brings_humanitarian_organization.html&#34;
  href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/dead-link/&#34;
  title=&#34;http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/79084/myspace_brings_humanitarian_organization.html [dead link]&#34;
  &gt;approaches to social networking&lt;/a
&gt;
seem to involve nothing more than acquiring banner space:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone out in the world needs help, all they have to do is look to MySpace.
You just have to get up on the wall at MySpace, and represent. Good things
will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can reach a large audience with MySpace, and statistically, with a
large enough audience you will have talented people volunteer their services.
But that&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;social networking,&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s just advertising &amp;ndash; if nonprofits could
easily and cheaply fly banner advertisements behind airplanes in the world&amp;rsquo;s
major cities, they would probably get a lot of volunteers, too. The only
difference in this case is that it&amp;rsquo;s electronic and (relatively) free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &amp;ndash; as our organization has certainly found out &amp;ndash; getting a lot of
volunteers often means getting a lot of people wanting to do things you don&amp;rsquo;t do
or can&amp;rsquo;t do (like volunteering to go to Darfur, or raising money for guns for
rebels, or adopting orphaned Darfurian children). Getting a lot of exposure all
of a sudden can overwhelm a nonprofit, and if there isn&amp;rsquo;t a clear understanding
already in place about how to effectively mobilize people toward actions that
will make a positive difference, then I would be worried about getting
distracted by chasing benefit concerts and bake sales all over the world.
Enthusiastic supporters are great, but sometimes you have to channel them in the
right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, even if online organizing dovetails well with community organizing, the
mobilizing of third-party advocates only effects change if that mobilization is
directed in a useful direction.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2006/12/theory-bottom-up-social-networking/&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; You might get a lot of people to sign a
petition, but does that actually aid the community you supposedly help? You
might attract a lot of donations, but does that actually support the people you
say you represent? &lt;strong&gt;These are classic nonprofit challenges that don&amp;rsquo;t go away
simply through electronic networking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online organizing doesn&amp;rsquo;t replace real on-the-ground community organizing or
empowerment. (This is actually one of my concerns with the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2006/07/an_interview_wi.html&#34;&gt;Second Life nonprofit fad&lt;/a&gt;,
but that&amp;rsquo;s for another post.) Action online only matters if it can be translated
into the real world, or if it can develop social bonds that provide the
framework for real-world action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there have been very few effective online campaigns (using
SNS or otherwise) with organizations that directly represent the communities
they organize (e.g. homeless rights movements as opposed to advocates from
the Global North raising money for Africa). The big one that comes to mind
is the immigrants rights marches in the United States. Yet in that case,
most of the mobilization came from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/voices-new-movimiento/&#34;&gt;radio DJs and existing labor ties&lt;/a&gt;,
not the Internet. And when social networking did come into play, such as the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/28/AR2006032800982.html&#34;&gt;student walkouts&lt;/a&gt;
in Virginia and Maryland, they were largely decentralized, with no
organization pointing the way or setting up MySpace profiles to encourage
the movement. &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2006/12/theory-bottom-up-social-networking/&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In his
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20061009224506/http://www.netsquared.org/conference/conference-sessions/making-the-most-of-disruption&#34;&gt;NetSquared presentation&lt;/a&gt;
with &lt;a href=&#34;https://rheingold.com/&#34;&gt;Howard Rheingold&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20061009230616/http://www.netsquared.org/conference/confirmed-presenters/paul-saffo-director-and-roy-amara-fellow-institute-for-the-future&#34;&gt;Paul Saffo&lt;/a&gt;
said that social movements, online and otherwise, &amp;ldquo;need elites&amp;rdquo; in order to
effect change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, this struck me as a popular myth &amp;ndash; that social movements never
accomplish things through activism alone &amp;ndash; when in fact that&amp;rsquo;s been pretty
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/force-powerful-english/&#34;&gt;spectacularly disproven&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then Paul continued, and said that what he meant was &amp;ldquo;thought leaders&amp;rdquo; like
Dr. King &amp;ndash; an instructive example, since his oratories and marches were
supported by a network of churches and supporters and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://highlandercenter.org/&#34;&gt;specific strategic planning&lt;/a&gt; that made his
leadership possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20061009234211/http://www.netsquared.org/conference/conference-sessions/conversation-with-angela-glover-blackwell&#34;&gt;Angela Glover-Blackwell&lt;/a&gt;
noted that traditionally, social change organizations had acted as the
representatives for the vulnerable. Now, those voices are breaking through
without the need for these nonprofits &amp;ndash; a potentially threatening prospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made me think about the different kinds of &amp;ldquo;elites&amp;rdquo; that social movements
and social networks engender. In my mind, there are four:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power elites&lt;/strong&gt; are the traditional decisionmakers, who might also be termed
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence&#34;&gt;Weberian elites&lt;/a&gt; because
of their support by the state. They have a strong hold on direct power, though
has been shown through nonviolent conflict and the &amp;ldquo;paradox of repression&amp;rdquo;
(think of the dictators overthrown by popular movements) they nonetheless
depend on a limited sort of consent from those over whom they rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource elites&lt;/strong&gt; are those who have the infrastructure (or the capacity to
develop it) to make things possible &amp;ndash; be that change or stasis. Traditionally
this has been people with the most money or natural resources; a relevant
aspect of this today would be people (or communities) with the most access to
technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idea elites&lt;/strong&gt; are the ideological leaders who emerge, either hierarchically
or communally, from a given social movement. These are the people who develop
policy and drive debates &amp;ndash; but much of their power comes from the movement
itself; while they can lead to a limited extent, they are always in danger of
losing their power to the next big thinker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literacy elites&lt;/strong&gt; are those who can &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; the situation. They might be the
ones most familiar with the technology (be that movable type or Movable Type)
or the ones most adept at community organizing. Today, they might be the
teenager who can navigate among the SNSes (and, as Howard Rheingold pointed
out, may even be unaware of their political power).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems important to me to keep these different types of elites in mind as we
think about the intersections of technology and social change. One way of
achieving change is by appealing to the state&amp;rsquo;s powerholders &amp;ndash; traditional
power, that is. But throughout history, coalitions of people without this power
have banded together to effect change. It may be that among the three other
types of elites, a social movement can emerge that represents true democratic
change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final thought:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20071009155523/http://www.netsquared.org/2006/conference/confirmed-presenters/daniel-ben-horin-founder-and-president-compumentor&#34;&gt;Daniel Ben-Horin&lt;/a&gt;
made an off-hand comment about how many people had been trained in a kind of
vanguard activism &amp;ndash; acting in the &amp;ldquo;best interests&amp;rdquo; of people. I think focusing
on these different kinds of elites allows for something closer to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://infed.org/mobi/paulo-freire-dialogue-praxis-and-education/&#34;&gt;Paolo Freire&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s
&amp;ldquo;cointentional education&amp;rdquo; in which everyone is a student and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20061230064445/http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~oliver/soc220/Lectures220/General/AntiRacism%20Quotes.htm&#34;&gt;liberation is bound up together&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Ethan Zuckerman makes a related point in his
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ethanzuckerman.com/2006/05/30/my-talk/&#34; title=&#34;Read the entire presentation at the NetSquared conference.&#34;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt;
when he says the new mantra for advocacy organizations should be: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t speak.
Point.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2006/05/different-kinds-elites-different-kinds-elitism/&#34;&gt;Different kinds of elites (and different kinds of elitism)&lt;/a&gt; originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rootwork.org&#34;&gt;Rootwork.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;First, I want to thank NetSquared for offering me and the

I had written out my introduction earlier this week, but due to a browser mishap
lost nearly all of it and haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to re-write it until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GI-Net is a nonprofit based in DC that is a little more than two years old. We
began as a student group at Swarthmore College with an idea: to change the way
the world responds to genocide. In her groundbreaking and Pulitzer Prize&amp;ndash;winning
book, &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;A Problem From Hell&amp;rsquo;: America and the Age of Genocide&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/why-cant-we/&#34; title=&#34;Read a recent commencement speech by Samantha Power&#34;&gt;Samantha Power&lt;/a&gt;
surveys the U.S. response to genocides in the twentieth century and discovers
that, above all, the reason the United States so often failed to act, or to act
too late or ineffectively, was simply because there was no political will. In
essence, it was easier for presidents and members of Congress to do nothing
while genocide was being perpetrated and apologize for it later, than risk
political capital taking action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of our origins as a student group, we have a strong history in using
online social networking and viral campaigns, and this continues even as we
branch out into other constituencies. In our first year of existence, we raised
a

for peacekeepers in Darfur &amp;ndash; the only NGO to raise money for protection rather
than humanitarian aid &amp;ndash; primarily through student networks, both actual and
virtual. In my work for GI-Net, I am heavily influenced by

&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070207093051/http://quixotic1.com/&#34; title=&#34;My website, quixotic1.com&#34;&gt;web developer&lt;/a&gt;
and artist (digitally and otherwise) with a strong interest in peacebuilding,
community organizing and empowerment. My major at Swarthmore was not
computer-related but rather peace and conflict studies, for which I wrote a
thesis on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20080828193419/http://quixoticlife.net/tpni&#34; title=&#34;Read more about the thesis&#34;&gt;third-party nonviolent intervention organizations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at Swarthmore I was involved with a number of campaigns, most notably
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20040113040820/http://why-war.com/&#34; title=&#34;Visit Why War?&#34;&gt;Why War?&lt;/a&gt;.
Why War? was a prominent site for news and analysis against the war (first
Afghanistan, and then Iraq). Its database from 2001&amp;ndash;2004 is the most
comprehensive accounting of articles and opinions on the war, resistance to it
and the movements that arose on each side. We are most well-known, however, for
a campaign that had little to do with the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, internal emails from the electronic voting machine manufacturer Diebold
emerged that suggested the company had misled voting officials in numerous
states about the security of its machines, had violated contracts with states by
installing new software that had not been certified, and had knowingly
implemented voting systems with severe security vulnerabilities. Investigative
journalist
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blackboxvoting.org/&#34; title=&#34;Bev Harris and Black Box Voting&#34;&gt;Bev Harris&lt;/a&gt; and
the UK
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20040803082657/http://www.why-war.com/news/2003/10/14/allthepr.html&#34; title=&#34;Article: All the President&#39;s Votes?&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
had documented some of the serious problems, but few had taken notice, and
Harris had been repeatedly threatened by her ISP, fearful of repercussions from
Diebold&amp;rsquo;s lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of Why War? decided to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20040712083338/http://www.why-war.com/features/2003/10/diebold.html&#34; title=&#34;View the Diebold files&#34;&gt;post an archive&lt;/a&gt;
of the internal files on his website. After Swarthmore threatened to shut off
our Internet access in the face of baseless copyright infringement claims from
Diebold, we initiated a global campaign of electronic civil disobedience, in
which students at universities would post mirrors of the files on their own
servers, staying ahead of each specious take-down request. Simultaneously, our
friends in what would become
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20060707010513/http://www.freeculture.org/&#34; title=&#34;FreeCulture.org&#34;&gt;FreeCulture.org&lt;/a&gt;
sued Diebold through the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2003/11/03&#34; title=&#34;Learn more about the Diebold case&#34;&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;
for abusive copyright threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of civil disobedience and civil action paid off handsomely.
Within two months, Diebold backed down from their legal threats and resigned
themselves to the damaging information about them now in the public domain.
Suspicion of Diebold and other electronic voting machine manufacturers &amp;ndash; and,
thus, consistent investigation into their practices &amp;ndash; remains high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;back-to-genocide&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Back to genocide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how does the Genocide Intervention Network use the Internet to effect social
change? There are three primary ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20060118220930/http://www.genocideintervention.net/donate/&#34; title=&#34;Learn more about donating to GI-Net&#34;&gt;raise money online&lt;/a&gt;
directly for peacekeepers in Darfur. This is unprecedented &amp;ndash; never before has
the average person been able to directly affect human security in the midst of a
genocide. We raise money through a variety of techniques such as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20060706215139/http://www.genocideintervention.net/fundraise/virtual.php&#34; title=&#34;Learn about virtual house parties&#34;&gt;virtual house parties&lt;/a&gt;
(a favorite among Facebook and MySpace users),
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20060706215126/http://www.genocideintervention.net/fundraise/dinners.php&#34; title=&#34;Learn about dinners for Darfur&#34;&gt;dinners for Darfur&lt;/a&gt;
and old-fashioned member volunteering. (A piano teacher in Utah giving two
weeks&amp;rsquo; proceeds; a &amp;ldquo;battle of the bands&amp;rdquo; fundraiser in California; a bat mitzvah
in New Jersey; a frat party in Massachusetts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second component is education. People can&amp;rsquo;t act against genocide unless they
know about it, which is why we partnered with the American Progress Action Fund
in 2005 to launch the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20060703175035/http://beawitness.org/splash/&#34; title=&#34;Visit BeAWitness.org&#34;&gt;Be A Witness campaign&lt;/a&gt;,
urging the news media to adequately cover the crisis in Darfur. Our analysis
showed that in June 2005, the major networks ran 50 times as many stories about
Michael Jackson and 12 times as many stories about Tom Cruise as about the
genocide in Darfur. In fact, in all of 2005 CBS ran just two minutes &amp;ndash; total &amp;ndash;
on the issue, a fact that motivated more than 30,000 viewers to take action
through the viral video and website. Because of the paltry news coverage, we
also issue
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20060706214512/http://www.genocideintervention.net/educate/darfurnews/&#34; title=&#34;Read the latest report from Darfur&#34;&gt;weekly news reports&lt;/a&gt;
from the ground in Darfur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we give our members the tools to advocate for protection in the face of
genocide. We use
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20060710155602/http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/organizationsORG/ginetwork/campaign.jsp?campaign_KEY=3407&#34; title=&#34;Read our most recent advocacy campaign&#34;&gt;Democracy in Action&lt;/a&gt;
to direct our national campaigns, and work closely with the

at the state level. In April, we brought more than 850 students to Washington,
D.C. as part of the

&gt;
weekend. The P2P website, which uses the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://drupal.org/&#34; title=&#34;Drupal.org&#34;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; open-source community platform, is
key to sustaining these activists through the summer, when they will act as the
catalysts for local anti-genocide groups in their hometowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;coming-up-next&#34; class=&#34;link_owner&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coming up next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in the planning stages of a number of exciting online campaigns to
further support the emerging anti-genocide movement. Our main website will be
moved to Drupal to allow our members to connect with local leaders and
organizations, and concretely affect the direction of the national campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photo petition, using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20060707182012/http://forwardtrack.eyebeamresearch.org/&#34; title=&#34;Learn about ForwardTrack&#34;&gt;ForwardTrack&lt;/a&gt;
and our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://flickr.com/photos/genocideintervention&#34; title=&#34;See our most recent photos on Flickr&#34;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;
account, will put a human face on the victims in Darfur. Viewers will be asked
to upload images of themselves holding a sign with &amp;ndash; not a comment or a pledge
&amp;ndash; but the name of one of the hundreds of thousands of victims in Darfur. These
photos will be delivered to members of Congress to show the depth of human
involvement &amp;ndash; and human crisis &amp;ndash; around Darfur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than one of our members has asked us to be their designated charity for a
marathon, and so our next fundraising tool will be a website to enable them to
do just that. Members will be able to distribute information about the race and
GI-Net, collect pledges online, and then follow-up with donors after the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be happy to talk further with any of you about GI-Net or

but this post is already mighty long, so I&amp;rsquo;ll stop here. Thanks again for
allowing me to come, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

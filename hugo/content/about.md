### Coding is just a small part of who I am

Technology is a means to an end, and shiny tech is not always the best means.

I've worked as a
[human rights advocate](https://web.archive.org/web/20080131080116/http://www.genocideintervention.net/),
a
[community organizer](https://web.archive.org/web/20111226083543/http://www.casinofreephilly.org:80/),
and a [nonprofit communications manager](https://forusa.org/). I've been on the
board of a [justice studies association](https://www.peacejusticestudies.org/),
helped
[nominate people for the Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.afsc.org/content/afsc-and-nobel-peace-prize),
wrote about
[third-party nonviolent intervention](https://works.swarthmore.edu/fac-soc-anth/29/)
and used
[electronic civil disobedience to fight insecure voting systems](https://web.archive.org/web/20050204141450/https://www.why-war.com/features/2003/11/diebold_analyzed.html).

Really all my technological expertise and interest stems from those larger
objectives for social change.

I'm also active in üö≤ [re-thinking urban spaces](https://www.streetsblog.org/),
ü•ï [local food cooperatives](https://www.peoples.coop/), and üîî
[semi-professional handbell performance](https://www.bellsofthecascades.org/about).

### Stats

Leaderboards are harmful to open-source development and sustainable communities
generally (read Cory Doctorow's
[_Walkaway_](https://www.worldcat.org/title/walkaway-a-novel/oclc/1159178249&referer=brief_results))
but insofar as some folks feel they need impersonal metrics of comparison, here
are mine:

**Devsigner is celebrating the cross-overs, the multi-disciplinarians, the coders who paint and the designers who send pull requests --- and those who want to develop some new left-right brain skills.**

We're looking for folks to break out of their familiar meetup silos and apply their knowledge across the crafts of development and design.

[**Join me at Devsigner in Portland, Oregon, May 23-25!**](https://web.archive.org/web/20140719090242/http://devsignercon.com/)

Tickets are [now on sale](https://web.archive.org/web/20140719090242/http://devsignercon.com/), and [session submissions are open](https://web.archive.org/web/20140719090242/http://devsignercon.com/) until this Friday, May 2!

It's been
[quite a while](/blog/2014/04/join-me-devsigner-conference-portland-may-designers-developers-join-forces/)
since I posted on this blog.

I got out of the habit of posting through a combination of factors:
[social media](https://twitter.com/rootwork) (as with everyone), shifting job
responsibilities, and adjusting my priorites to spend some of the time I used to
devote to work and work-adjacent things &#8212; like blogging &#8212; to other
pursuits.

In 2014 I was primarily a freelancer working on Drupal websites. I had been
working at the [Fellowship of Reconciliation](https://forusa.org/), an
interfaith peace and justice group, primarily as a web developer until then.
Increasingly that shifted into more online communications responsibilities. I
strategized for advocacy campaigns, planned out fundraising drives, and
supported content creation (not to mention
[on-the-ground activism](https://web.archive.org/web/20160419200729/http://forusa.org/blogs/ivan-boothe/honoring-active-nonviolence-us-middle-east/11909)).

I gratefully accepted
[an NTENny award](https://web.archive.org/web/20150407225011/http://www.nten.org/awards/2014/ntenny)
from the [Nonprofit Technology Network](https://www.nten.org/) in 2014 for some
of this work, and the presentations I gave at the annual Nonprofit Technology
Conference each year. (In 2015 I got to
[introduce Fight for the Future and my friend Evan Greer](https://www.slideshare.net/rootwork/saving-the-internet-with-the-internet-the-net-neutrality-victory-as-a-case-study)
to a wider audience at the NTC.)

While my work at FOR was fulfilling, they didn't always have the budget to
support a full-time job for me. So in 2016 I joined
[CoLab Cooperative](https://colab.coop/) as a senior Drupal developer. I had a
great time doing styleguide&#8211;driven development and component-based design
like [PatternLab](https://patternlab.io/). But as has been true throughout my
career, I continued to center social justice as the framing of my work. With
CoLab's support, I spoke about
[Doing good with Drupal and beyond](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanboothe/details/experience/1103947024/multiple-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAABl33EBS2mPp7MzOR78g03Gb0rtewlEVQw&treasuryMediaId=1527283177501)
at the 2018 [Pacific Northwest Drupal Summit](https://pnwdrupalsummit.org):

It's been
[quite a while](/blog/2014/04/join-me-devsigner-conference-portland-may-designers-developers-join-forces/)
since I posted on this blog.

I got out of the habit of posting through a combination of factors:
[social media](https://twitter.com/rootwork) (as with everyone), shifting job
responsibilities, and adjusting my priorites to spend some of the time I used to
devote to work and work-adjacent things &#8212; like blogging &#8212; to
[other pursuits](https://www.bellsofthecascades.org/about).

### Nonprofit communications

In 2014 I was primarily a freelancer working on Drupal websites. I had been
working at the [Fellowship of Reconciliation](https://forusa.org/), an
interfaith peace and justice group, primarily as a web developer until then.
Increasingly that shifted into more online communications responsibilities. I
strategized for advocacy campaigns, planned out fundraising drives, and
supported content creation (not to mention
[on-the-ground activism](https://web.archive.org/web/20160419200729/http://forusa.org/blogs/ivan-boothe/honoring-active-nonviolence-us-middle-east/11909)).

I gratefully accepted
[an NTENny award](https://web.archive.org/web/20150407225011/http://www.nten.org/awards/2014/ntenny)
from the [Nonprofit Technology Network](https://www.nten.org/) in 2014 for some
of this work, and the presentations I gave at the annual Nonprofit Technology
Conference each year. (In 2015 I got to
[introduce Fight for the Future and my friend Evan Greer](https://www.slideshare.net/rootwork/saving-the-internet-with-the-internet-the-net-neutrality-victory-as-a-case-study)
to a wider audience at the NTC.)

### Frontend engineering with Drupal

While my work at FOR was fulfilling, they didn't always have the budget to
support a full-time job for me. So in 2016 I joined
[CoLab Cooperative](https://colab.coop/) as a senior Drupal developer. I had a
great time doing styleguide&#8211;driven development and component-based design
like [PatternLab](https://patternlab.io/).

As has been true throughout my career, I continued to center social justice as
the framing of my work. With CoLab's support, I spoke on "Doing good with Drupal
and beyond" at the 2018
[Pacific Northwest Drupal Summit](https://pnwdrupalsummit.org):

{{< youtube id="gtVmPMqnsvI" title="Recording of 'Doing good with Drupal and beyond' from the 2018 Pacific Northwest Drupal Summit" >}}

(You can see
[the slides on their own on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanboothe/details/experience/1103947024/multiple-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAABl33EBS2mPp7MzOR78g03Gb0rtewlEVQw&treasuryMediaId=1527283177501).)

### Old websites and new tools

Way back in the dark ages of the Internet &#8212; 1996! &#8212; I had built a
website for my parents'
[titanium wedding ring business](https://www.titaniumringsforever.com/). That
website continued to be updated, including moving onto Drupal Commerce in its
last two iterations, before finally being retired.

Along the way, they began selling a safer cleaning solution for titanium,
[Multi-Etch](https://www.multietch.com/), and it became their primary business.
So after years of helping them out here and there, in 2020 they hired me
full-time as CIO. A little bit of my work involves web development, but a lot of
it is more along the lines of customer management and communications. It's a
field I've had to learn a lot about, but it's also given me time and tools to
broaden my technology experience.

Consequently, while I'm still a part of the Drupal community &#8212; I
volunteered as a contribution mentor at
[DrupalCon Portland 2022](https://events.drupal.org/portland2022) &#8212; I've
spent the last few years learning a whole bunch of new skills. Some of those
include: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (the static site generator now powering
rootwork.org),
"[back of the frontend](https://css-tricks.com/front-of-the-front-back-of-the-front/)"
Node, and [MJML](https://mjml.io/). I also invested time in areas where I'd
wanted to get familiar for years: Bash scripting, SVGs and animation, and using
Linux as my daily workstation.

All of those tools and technologies fit into my work with Multi-Etch in some
way, and as a result I have several projects spanning some of these areas that
I'm excited to share in coming blog posts.

### Things that go together

As my [about page](/about/) (now) says, I have:

> worked as a
> [human rights advocate](https://web.archive.org/web/20080131080116/http://www.genocideintervention.net/),
> a
> [community organizer](https://web.archive.org/web/20111226083543/http://www.casinofreephilly.org:80/),
> and a [nonprofit communications manager](https://forusa.org/). I've been on
> the board of a
> [justice studies association](https://www.peacejusticestudies.org/), helped
> [nominate people for the Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.afsc.org/content/afsc-and-nobel-peace-prize),
> wrote about
> [third-party nonviolent intervention](https://works.swarthmore.edu/fac-soc-anth/29/)
> and used
> [electronic civil disobedience to fight insecure voting systems](https://web.archive.org/web/20050204141450/https://www.why-war.com/features/2003/11/diebold_analyzed.html).

All of that went alongside (and was often funded by) my technological work. But
as in the past, I'll continue to write about
[the intersections between activism and technology](/blog/2014/03/online-advocacy-learn-community-organizing/),
both the positive and negative. I hope you'll join me for the journey!

Today at the
[Peace and Justice Studies Association 2009 Conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20091013231101/http://www.peacejusticestudies.org/conference 'Read more about the conference')
at Marquette University, I hosted a workshop called,
"[Finding the Movement's Voice: Online Social Networks and Social Change](https://web.archive.org/web/20091013231106/http://www.peacejusticestudies.org/conference/sessions.php?con=C.4)":

The subtitle of this workshop could be, "Social change has always relied on
social networks -- they just weren't called Facebook." I'm going to be talking
concretely about the _strategy_ of using online tools for social change. This
won't be an ain't-it-cool presentation of shiny technology, nor will it be a
technical exploration of complicated software. It will be an interactive how-to
on making social change work more effective by using online social technology.

While I did use a set of slides, the workshop was participatory and the slides
were mostly illustrative; I hope to publish them here and on
[Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/rootwork) with a voiceover soon, but
they're probably not worth posting otherwise.

What I can post is an extended set of resources and tools for those pursuing
social change and want to engage folks online. In addition, much of my
presentation was drawn on earlier presentations and writing, including:

- [Gurus Are Not Enough: A Call for Organizers and Organizing in Social Media](/blog/2009/09/gurus-are-not-enough-call-organizers-organizing-social-media)
- [Social change takes more than social media](/blog/2009/05/social-change-takes-more-social-media)
- [Using Social Networks for Social Change: Facebook, MySpace and More](/blog/2008/10/using-social-networks-social-change-facebook-myspace-more)
- [Community blogs run better on open-source software](/blog/2009/01/community-blogs-run-better-open-source-software)

You may also be interested in some of my earlier academic work on
[third-party nonviolent intervention and unarmed peacekeeping](https://web.archive.org/web/20100129053652/http://quixoticlife.net/topics/tpni),
including a presentation from the 2005 PJSA conference and some of my analysis
published in the journal _Peace & Change_.

  of our communities, and build the networks necessary to address the root
  causes of the problems we face.

#### My background

I am the creative director of Rootwork.org, working with nonprofits and social
change groups, developing websites and doing online strategy around advocacy,
fundraising and member engagement. I helped found the
[Genocide Intervention Network](https://web.archive.org/web/20091012093907/http://www.genocideintervention.net/)
and worked there for four years, first as the director of communications and
later as Internet strategy coordinator.

In 2003, I was part of
[why-war.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20091012093907/http://why-war.org/),
which launched a nationwide campaign of electronic civil disobedience against
the voting machine manufacturer Diebold. Subsequently I've worked with several
social change groups including [Soulforce](https://soulforce.org/) and

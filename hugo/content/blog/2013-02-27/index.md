Tomorrow at 1PM Eastern/10AM Pacific,
[Johanna Bates](https://devcollaborative.com/about-us) and I will be co-hosting
the monthly Nonprofit Drupal Community of Practice discussion and Q&A call.

**This is a free conference call, sponsored by the Nonprofit Technology Network
(NTEN) but open to anyone.
[Please join us!](https://groups.drupal.org/node/283848)**

### What will we talk about?

This is a time to chat informally with other nonprofit-tech Drupalists -- an
open Q&A discussion for anyone with or in nonprofits or social change groups
using Drupal. But generally speaking:

- Stuck on something? Have a question? Drupal experts will be on hand to answer
  questions. (No question is too basic. Really.)
- Psyched about a module or a Drupal event? Come tell us about it on the call!
- What's happening with Drupal 8? Some of us know stuff. Join us, let's chat
  about it.

**We're open to questions or topic suggestions ahead of time -- just leave a
comment below or message me on Twitter
[@rootwork](https://twitter.com/rootwork).**

Johanna and I will take collaborative notes on the call
([notes from January's discussion are here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_D3_YPJv1tMFzicfgnM6N0xTn86wGGSe5cxmSEbnLdg/edit))
so if you can't make it just let us know if you'd like a link to the notes.

### Join the call!

On Thursday, Feb. 28 at 1PM Eastern/10AM Pacfic, just **dial in to (866)
740-1260 and enter the access code 3979222**.

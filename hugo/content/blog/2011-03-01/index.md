The
[Community TechKnowledge Foundation](https://web.archive.org/web/20150910223614/http://communitytech.net/)
announced today a grant of $10,000 for a nonprofit that submits a description of
their mission -- in the form of a poem. Along with the grant, the poetry will be
turned into a song by
[Bill Dillon](https://web.archive.org/web/20150910223614/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-10-07/entertainment/ct-live-1007-william-dillon-20101007_1_evanston-florida-man-redemption-song),
a songwriter who was wrongfully imprisoned for 27 years and freed by the
[Innocence Project of Florida](https://www.floridainnocence.org/).

There are also secondary prizes for $5,000, $1,000, and guitars autographed by
members of Los Lonely Boys. (A tertiary prize, "tech grants" from CTK, probably
aren't worth it as they only last for three months and lock you into their
proprietary system -- but you don't have to include an application for these
grants in your submission.)

[Read more information about the grant](https://web.archive.org/web/20150910223614/http://communitytech.net/foundation),
or take a look at the
[grant application](https://web.archive.org/web/20150910223614/https://www.ctkodm.com/ctkfoundationgrant/).
The deadline is March 28.

If you don't feel up to turning your mission into poetry, this is a great
opportunity to solicit submissions from your supporters. Even if you don't win,
you may have some useful new language to talk about what you do!

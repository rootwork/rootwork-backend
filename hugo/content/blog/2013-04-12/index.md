Dan Pallotta, who presented the TED talk,
“[The way we think about charity is dead wrong](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong),”
spoke at the [Nonprofit Technology Conference](https://www.nten.org/ntc/) this
morning.

His arguments, which are not particularly new, are that nonprofits are under
restraints — some culturally, and some self-imposed — that limit their
potential. If only charities were run more like businesses, he says — with high
executive pay and less belief in large “overhead” being a stand-in for
inefficiency — they’d be able to do more.

**Dan follows in the long tradition of successful businessmen (it’s almost
always men) arriving on the nonprofit scene talking loudly and listening
rarely.**

His ideas are wrong almost by design, because Dan isn’t interested in making
nonprofits more powerful; he’s interested in making society more receptive to
unrestrained business — nonprofits, in this case, are merely a proxy.

> “**He is not a credible defender of nonprofits** because he doesn’t seem to
> really care for them. He appears not to grasp the notion that markets fail—and
> that one of nonprofits’ primary roles is to address those failures, not mimic
> corporations. He has consistently disparaged nonprofits. In a _Harvard
> Business Review_ blog, he wrote that he’d be hard pressed to think of any
> business that wasn’t making more of a positive difference in society than
> nonprofits.”

> “**Just as he makes a fetish out of unrestrained capitalism**, he makes a
> fetish out of cash over other means of securing happiness and satisfaction at
> work. How insulting to think that, if we make less pay than our for profit
> counterparts, we must be less creative, talented, intelligent and less capable

**The entire approach is based on the scarcity-model, zero-sum game that people
like to play with charities.** In the past I’ve referred to this as
[nonprofit deathmatch](/blog/2010/12/google-chrome-cause-or-nonprofit-deathmatch-strikes-again).

Yet lots of research has shown people who donate once are
[more likely](https://web.archive.org/web/20150911224753/http://www.articlesbase.com/non-profit-organizations-articles/the-16-principles-of-personal-fundraising-influence-5204143.html)

{{< deadlink "https://twitter.com/MollyZerener/status/121363610214739968" "again" >}},
even to other organizations in the same field — it’s why some nonprofits sell
their lists. And the same principle is at work with advocacy:
[get people interested](https://joymayer.com/2010/10/01/the-nonprofit-worlds-ladder-of-engagement/)
and they’ll [keep](https://bethkanter.org/tweet-huggers/)
[taking](https://www.nonprofitmarketingguide.com/chucking-the-ladder-of-engagement/)
[action](http://groundwire.org/blog/groundwire-engagement-pyramid/).

**Getting away from the scarcity model allows organizations to
[build movements](https://web.archive.org/web/20130812124615/http://e.myntc.zerista.com/event/member/65121)
instead of just lists.**

It’s not suprising that his views are so limited when he consistently groups all
organizations into “nonprofits” or “charities” without recognizing the huge
differences among them.

Service organizations have very different goals from advocacy-based
organizations, to say nothing of institutional nonprofits like universities,
hospitals and museums. But they’re all just the “nonprofit sector” to him.

**Dan also has little use for any vision of social change, or any apparent
understanding of social movements**, since none that could be called successful
have in any way fit his vision. Because Dan’s vision isn’t one of social change,
it’s one of a perpetuation of wealth, with nonprofits simply one more business
sector in which to advertise.

Capitalism isn’t the solution. It’s the problem, and many of us are fighting it.

It’s no wonder Dan is so popular among the TED crowd — business leaders and
wealthy technologists who can see a product in every social trend.

**What’s more mystifying is why Dan Pallotta would be popular among nonprofits,
activists, and social changemakers. It’s clear Dan has no substantive message
for them.**

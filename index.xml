Classes, IDs, elements and pseudo-elements, with style definitions attached to each. Calling it a &amp;ldquo;language&amp;rdquo; is a bit of a stretch (though preprocessors like &lt;a href="https://sass-lang.com">Sass&lt;/a> fit the bill).&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>But let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, for years our stylesheets cascaded right on out to infinity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Huge files with table-of-contents comments to try to make some sense of it &amp;ndash; until a quick fix got pasted down at the bottom. Brittle style definitions relying on tight coupling with HTML structure. Pieces of styles being replicated here and there for different components with similar features, without any way to tell they were related in the CSS.&lt;/p> &lt;p>My stylesheets were like that too, because strategies for writing CSS had barely altered since the days when it was used to change the colors of the scroll bars in Internet Explorer. Luckily, in the past couple of years both &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-extends-placeholders">CSS architecture and CSS preprocessors came into their own&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p> &lt;figure> &lt;picture> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/we-need-talk-about-your-stylesheets-interview-jonathan-snook-drupalcon-portland/jonathansnook.avif" type="image/avif"> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/we-need-talk-about-your-stylesheets-interview-jonathan-snook-drupalcon-portland/jonathansnook.webp" type="image/webp"> &lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Jonathan Snook ::legacy-float-r" class="image_figure image_internal image_processed" width="66" height="100" src="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/we-need-talk-about-your-stylesheets-interview-jonathan-snook-drupalcon-portland/jonathansnook.jpg" title=" " /> &lt;/picture> &lt;/figure> &lt;strong>SMACSS&lt;/strong>, or &lt;a href="http://smacss.com/">Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS&lt;/a>, was developed by &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://snook.ca/">Jonathan Snook&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>, a featured speaker at Drupalcon Portland. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to get the opportunity to have Jonathan speak, not only because of my personally well-dog-eared copy of &lt;em>SMACSS&lt;/em>, but because Drupal itself is &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/world-class-frontend-track-drupalcon-portland">adopting a SMACSS approach&lt;/a> to its CSS.&lt;/p> &lt;p>I spoke with Jonathan about sustainable stylesheets and the future of SMACSS.

We&amp;rsquo;re no longer just building sites with a design for a home page and an inside page. We&amp;rsquo;re developing complex systems that need to work in a variety of contexts and we need a development approach that complements that.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;a href="http://smacss.com/"> &lt;figure> &lt;picture> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/we-need-talk-about-your-stylesheets-interview-jonathan-snook-drupalcon-portland/smacss-book.avif" type="image/avif"> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/we-need-talk-about-your-stylesheets-interview-jonathan-snook-drupalcon-portland/smacss-book.webp" type="image/webp"> &lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="SMACSS ::legacy-float-l" class="image_figure image_internal image_processed" width="200" height="266" src="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/we-need-talk-about-your-stylesheets-interview-jonathan-snook-drupalcon-portland/smacss-book.png" title=" " /> &lt;/picture> &lt;/figure> &lt;/a>&lt;strong>IB: What&amp;rsquo;s the biggest &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; you see in using the SMACSS approach? Why should frontend developers change their approach to CSS?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>JS: The biggest win is maintainability. The SMACSS methodology makes it easier to build larger projects by breaking things down into smaller components. Like the move from spaghetti code to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC&lt;/a> frameworks on the server side, this separation of concerns on the CSS side improves the process of putting a site or web app together.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: In the last part of your book, you talk about how the SMACSS approach fits in to work using a preprocessor like Sass. There have been a lot of developments in Sass in the past year &amp;ndash; have they had any positive effects on your use of the SMACSS approach?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>JS: With Sass, the introduction of placeholders was a positive step forward. Overall, Sass (and other preprocessors) are a great way to augment &amp;ndash; but not replace &amp;ndash; the way people write CSS.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: What are your thoughts on &lt;a href="https://en.bem.info/">BEM&lt;/a>? Do you see it as compatible with SMACSS?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>JS: I see BEM as very compatible. BEM really enforces naming convention, which is a very important concept in SMACSS. They both take a modular approach to site development.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: What are you tacking next when it comes to CSS and frontend development? Will there be a &amp;ldquo;SMACSS Part Two&amp;rdquo;? Or something else entirely?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>JS: I&amp;rsquo;d love to augment SMACSS with case studies and expand on some of the ideas in the book based on things that come up in the workshops I do. I&amp;rsquo;d also like to work on a prototyping/site development tool that uses the SMACSS concepts. We had built something like this when I was at Yahoo! that I think many people in the industry would find really useful. Hopefully I can find the time to work on it!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Drupalcon Portland: Responsive web design in a snap with Breakpoint and Sass</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupalcon-portland-responsive-web-design-snap-breakpoint-sass/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupalcon-portland-responsive-web-design-snap-breakpoint-sass/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Media queries&lt;/strong> are a key part of responsive web design, because they control at what width (among other things) different CSS rules kick in.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://breakpoint-sass.com/">Breakpoint&lt;/a> makes writing media queries in Sass super simple,&amp;rdquo; say &lt;strong>Mason Wendell&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Sam Richard&lt;/strong>, creators of the extension to &lt;a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass&lt;/a>, and they&amp;rsquo;re right. It&amp;rsquo;s not surprising that we&amp;rsquo;d want them to present at Drupalcon, since design in Drupal, like web design everywhere, has been embracing responsive web design as a fundamental principle. (Side note: This website is in the midst of a responsive web design overhaul. Cobbler&amp;rsquo;s children and all that.)&lt;/p> &lt;p>I spoke to Mason and Sam about how Breakpoint makes responsive web design even easier. Don&amp;rsquo;t miss &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/session/managing-responsive-web-design-sass-and-breakpoint.html">their Drupalcon Portland frontend session, &amp;ldquo;Managing Responsive Web Design with Sass and Breakpoint,&amp;rdquo; on Thursday at 10:45 AM&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p> &lt;hr> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: What motivated you to create Breakpoint? How has it changed your own workflow?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>MW: Before Sass 3.2 came out I had written an article for The Sass Way that previewed some of it&amp;rsquo;s new features, including the ability to use variables in media queries. I created an example that baked in some names for breakpoints into a kind of &amp;ldquo;master mixin&amp;rdquo; for media queries. On my next responsive project I put the theories I&amp;rsquo;d written for that post into practice, and found that I could refine that approach. If I assigned a variable to each media query first the approach would be very flexible. Then when noticed that I wrote min-width queries way more often than any other type I set up defaults that made creating media queries very fast.&lt;/p> &lt;p>MW: There was a side effect that I think is more useful though. By assigning names to each of my media queries I&amp;rsquo;m able to keep them in context in a much more effective way. If I some media queries to deal with the width of a nav element, and then later I add an item to that nav, I can change the value of that variable and all the associated queries are adjusted. This is even more effective when handing code back and forth within a team.&lt;/p> &lt;p>SR: Breakpoint was created with the motivation to ease many of the pain points of working with media queries in CSS. The biggest pain point that Breakpoint solves is providing meaningful semantics to your media queries. When building content based responsive sites, early in your design process two unrelated items may happen to break at the same points, but as your project grows, those points may change and a simple find and replace will have unintended consequences. This is probably the biggest workflow win to using Breakpoint, all of your media queries now have proper semantics.&lt;/p> &lt;p>SR: The other big win for my workflow is Breakpoint&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/at-import/breakpoint/wiki/No-Query-Fallbacks">no-query fallback&lt;/a>, allowing me to very easily add in fallback code for any of the media queries I write.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: What can Breakpoint do that just assigning variable names to specific min-widths can&amp;rsquo;t?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>SR: For starters, Breakpoint handles much more than min-width queries. It is designed to be future friendly and currently supports all CSS level 3 and level 4 media queries. Additionally, it&amp;rsquo;s syntax is easy to use to create complex media queries, including both and and or media queries. It has native handling for all of the different media query requirement for resolution (of which you need to write at least four different queries for currently) while just writing the standard. The no-query fallbacks are a huge win as well.&lt;/p> &lt;p>MW: The main benefit is that you can assign names and manage your media queries with variables. This helps you avoid having them scattered around your SCSS, and makes is easy to understand how they&amp;rsquo;re related and affect each other.&lt;/p> &lt;p>MW: While Breakpoint is optimized for min-width because they&amp;rsquo;re used most often it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there. There are a number of shortcuts built in, for fencing min- and max- values, converting pixels to ems, and even vendor prefixed queries like resolution.&lt;/p> &lt;p>MW: We even created a way to Breakpoint to report back to you what queries are in a particular context. &lt;a href="https://github.com/at-import/Singularity">Singularity GS&lt;/a> uses this feature to kind of magically create responsive grid systems.&lt;/p> &lt;p>SR: Of all of Breakpoint&amp;rsquo;s features, probably the least used, but most powerful is &lt;a href="https://github.com/at-import/breakpoint/wiki/Breakpoint-Context">Breakpoint Context&lt;/a>. This allows you to call a function anywhere and get the current media query context allowing for amazingly intelligent mixins and functions to be written in Sass, something unique to Breakpoint that you simply don&amp;rsquo;t have with interpolating variables.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: Are there any responsive web design aspects specific to Drupal theming/frontend development that Breakpoint helps with?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>SR: There is nothing Drupal specific that Breakpoint helps with. Breakpoint, like Sass, was built to be backend independent. This means that if you are building any site, regardless of if it&amp;rsquo;s a Drupal site or a Node site or a static site, Breakpoint is able to do its job handily without being caught up in being tied to a specific backend technology.&lt;/p> &lt;p>MW: One of the things I love about working with Sass is that it&amp;rsquo;s not Drupal-specific, and it&amp;rsquo;s meant to be used anywhere on the web. Breakpoint follows that example.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: Is Breakpoint a successor to &lt;a href="https://github.com/snugug/respond-to">Respond-To&lt;/a>, or will that continue to get developed?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>SR: In a way, yes and no. Respond-To was written before Breakpoint, but upon Breakpoint&amp;rsquo;s release, it was decided that our efforts should be focused on a unified Media Query engine, with Respond-To as a wrapper syntax for Breakpoint. This is how the current Respond-To project exists. As of Breakpoint 2.0, the Respond-To mixin has been incorporated into Breakpoint core, so you now can use Respond-To without needing an additional Compass extension!&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: Do you use &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/breakpoints">Breakpoints module&lt;/a> (in Drupal 8 core)? Or do you just do all of that through Sass?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>SR: I personally truly dislike the Breakpoint module. Every use case I&amp;rsquo;ve heard for it seems to be based on the thinking that sites have three or four breakpoints and that everything can be boiled down into an easy to use admin interface. There are no standard breakpoints, period, and good, reasonably complex responsive sites will usually have 20 or more breakpoints. Responsive cannot be done from the backend, and the Breakpoint module encourages you to do so (as does the &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/spark">Spark layout initiative&lt;/a>).&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: Do you think any aspects of Breakpoint might get rolled directly into Sass in the future?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>MW: It&amp;rsquo;s possible, but we probably won&amp;rsquo;t move the obvious parts to the Sass language. There are some helper functions that we&amp;rsquo;ve written in Ruby that would be very useful in Sass core. Once that&amp;rsquo;s in we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to offer Breakpoint without Compass.&lt;/p> &lt;p>SR: I do not believe Breakpoint will be rolled directly into Sass, nor would I want it to be, as it is out of scope of Sass core. As much as I like them, I even think the color functions in Sass are out of scope for it. Sass core should simply be the language and the bare minimum function base for it to be useable. Sass doesn&amp;rsquo;t ship with any mixins, and I think it should probably stay that way. That being said, Breakpoint is fairly stable; our 1.3 release stood stable for six or so months without needing any changes until we rewrote the whole thing for our 2.x release, so maybe being merged into Compass isn&amp;rsquo;t out of the question, but I do not see a need for that.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: I hear in addition to Breakpoint, Sam went and created some kind of magic box of Sass called &lt;a href="https://github.com/at-import/toolkit">Toolkit&lt;/a>. Want to say more about that?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>SR: Toolkit started life as RWD Kickstart, a project Mason and I kind of made up on the spot a year ago at one of the first New York Sass meetups. Its original goal was simply to be a collection of Compass templates to make pulling in media query and grid solutions together easily. Since then, it&amp;rsquo;s evolved to be more of a collection of Progressive Enhancement, Design in Browser, and Modern Web Development tools, a toolkit if you&amp;rsquo;ll let me, of useful tools. I&amp;rsquo;d say the four biggest thing that Toolkit has are a modern Clearfix mixin, progressive enhancement replace text mixins, a triangle generation mixin, and an intrinsic ratio mixin to make using intrinsic ratios super easy. It also adds &lt;code>*, *:before, *:after { box-sizing: border-box}&lt;/code> and &lt;code>img, video { max-width: 100%; height: auto; }&lt;/code> to your stylesheets, which are the first two things I do for any responsive project.&lt;/p> &lt;p>SR: Toolkit&amp;rsquo;s templates have also evolved, Where originally there were five some odd different templates to choose from, now there are just two, a basic one to set up a basic partial structure, and a responsive web design one that pulls in Breakpoint 2.x for media queries and Singularity 1.x for grids.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: You &lt;a href="http://breakpoint-sass.com/">sure know&lt;/a> those late twentieth-century presidents.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>MW: With a name like Breakpoint, how could I not revisit the cinema classic Point Break. Bodhi and his gang of thrill-seeking bank-robbing surfers evaded the FBI for years until the newly minted Special Agent Johnny Utah was on the case. I think we can all agree that there&amp;rsquo;s a poignant metaphor for web designer there. And some pretty sweet GIFs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Drupal 8 and the power of Twig: A Drupalcon Portland featured session</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-power-twig-drupalcon-portland-featured-session/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-power-twig-drupalcon-portland-featured-session/</guid><description>&lt;p>A new theming engine, &lt;a href="https://twig.symfony.com/">Twig&lt;/a>, is coming along with &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/tags/drupal">Drupal&lt;/a> 8&amp;rsquo;s adoption of the Symfony framework. And it&amp;rsquo;s downright magical.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Instead of having theme functions that have to be overridden, everything becomes an (easy to read, easy to modify) template. Instead of having to figure out render arrays, themers can use consistent template variables. And instead of having insecure output, Twig sanitizes everything by default.&lt;/p> &lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked on a &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/tags/wordpress">WordPress&lt;/a> or Tumblr theme, the approach will feel pretty similar.

There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/sprints.html">Twig-focused sprint happening right after Drupalcon&lt;/a>, so if you think this is great, come pitch in! Because if things don&amp;rsquo;t get done, Twig will be held until Drupal 9. No Drupal themer, veteran or newbie, kitten or human, wants that to happen.&lt;/p> &lt;p>I spoke to &lt;strong>Jen Lampton&lt;/strong> (with a contribution from &lt;strong>Fabian Franz&lt;/strong>) about how Twig will result in happier veteran Drupal themers, happier new Drupal themers, and happier Drupal kittens. Be sure to show up for their &lt;a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/session/using-twig-new-template-engine-drupal-8.html">&lt;strong>featured Drupalcon session (along with Drupal CSS innovator John Albin Wilkins), &amp;ldquo;Using Twig: The new template engine in Drupal 8,&amp;rdquo; on Wednesday at 3:45 PM.&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>&lt;/p> &lt;hr> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: What&amp;rsquo;s one thing you&amp;rsquo;re most excited about with Twig?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>JL: Replacing the template engine with something completely different means that we get to take a good hard look at absolutely everything in the current theme system, so we can do a clean sweep.&lt;/p> &lt;p>FF: What I love the most about Twig is the syntax, and how it cleverly makes it possible to &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1982024">lazy-render things&lt;/a>. The possibilities of having an interpreted language are endless.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: Can theme developers start converting/creating their themes now?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>JL: No! If you have the time to start converting your own themes, then please, please, please use the time to help us make the theme system what you want it to be &amp;ndash; instead. There will be time to convert your themes later, but Drupal itself can only be monumentally improved &lt;em>right now&lt;/em>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: Will frontend developers and themers coming from other CMSes &amp;ndash; like WordPress &amp;ndash; find Twig easier to use?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>JL: Yes. Front end developers coming from everywhere will find Twig easier to use. For starters, Twig looks a lot more like HTML, so if you don&amp;rsquo;t know PHP you&amp;rsquo;ll still be right at home. For people who do know PHP and don&amp;rsquo;t know Twig, there will be a learning curve, but it&amp;rsquo;s far far FAR less steep than learning about what Drupal had done to PHPTemplate.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: Twig sounds great! What can people do to help make sure it happens for Drupal 8?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>JL: There are four main areas where we need help right now, as outlined in our &lt;a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/278968">Twig TODO wiki&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;ol> &lt;li>Help us test all the patches.&lt;/li> &lt;li>Help us fix issues with the patches.&lt;/li> &lt;li>Help us improve the markup in core (after being converted to Twig).&lt;/li> &lt;li>Help us clean up the rest of the theme system.&lt;/li> &lt;/ol> &lt;p>If people are interested in any one of these four areas, they can &lt;a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/sprints.html">come to the sprint immediately following DrupalCon&lt;/a> and get some hands-on help making Drupal better. We need all the hands we can get since we are up against some major deadlines, so please please please come help us!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Drupal 8, aural interfaces and groundbreaking accessibility at Drupalcon Portland</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-aural-interfaces-groundbreaking-accessibility-drupalcon-portland/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-aural-interfaces-groundbreaking-accessibility-drupalcon-portland/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a millennial, but even I remember the experience of calling the telephone operator and getting a live human to look up the number of a business or place a collect call.

But from the beginning, improving the experience for everyone has been a big priority, and one of the most exciting developments is a new aural interface.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>That&amp;rsquo;s right, Drupal is getting a switchboard operator:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p> &lt;figure> &lt;picture> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-aural-interfaces-groundbreaking-accessibility-drupalcon-portland/drupal-announce-log.avif" type="image/avif"> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-aural-interfaces-groundbreaking-accessibility-drupalcon-portland/drupal-announce-log.webp" type="image/webp"> &lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Drupal announce log showing three &amp;amp;amp;ldquo;polite Drupal announcements&amp;amp;amp;rdquo;" class="image_figure image_internal image_processed" width="675" height="48" src="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-aural-interfaces-groundbreaking-accessibility-drupalcon-portland/drupal-announce-log.png" /> &lt;/picture> &lt;/figure> &lt;/p> &lt;p>OK, so that doesn&amp;rsquo;t look &lt;em>terribly&lt;/em> exciting all on its own. But trust me, when you watch the videos of people interacting with Drupal 8 and having menus and selections read as they go, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool.&lt;/p> &lt;p>When I spoke with J. Renée about Drupal 8 and the nature of working on accessibility, the passion for this work really shown through. I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to their session with Wim, &lt;a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/node/2158.html">&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Drupal Speaks: Aural user interfaces, new Drupal 8 accessibility features,&amp;rdquo; on Wednesday at 10:45 AM.&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> Hope to see you there!&lt;/p> &lt;hr> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: What are we missing when we talk about accessibility right now?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>JRB: I want developers to understand that accessibility is fundamental to user interface development. We tend to talk about accessibility like we talk about gender. Both have coded values. When we speak of being gendered, we are often talking about being non-male. Male is a kind of genderless base state. So is it with accessibility. When we speak of making something accessible, we tend to refer to making an interface for blind users or for users with physical capabilities that make keyboard and mouse use difficult, as examples. Visual is a kind of accessible base state.&lt;/p> &lt;p>We risk &amp;ldquo;othering&amp;rdquo; folks for whom accessibility is an issue because as developers, in general, non-visual accessibility has not been a primary concern. I know what is is like to be othered. In some ways, highlighting otherness can be an effective way to bring focus to a problem. Eventually though, we need to resolve those issues and close the loop on the otherness. We can be other and also be equal. Now is the time for front end developers to start thinking about accessibility as a multi-modal effort. We no longer have the excuse that the tools and technologies available to us do not support efficient workflows for non-visual UI development.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: Where is Drupal 8 going to do better?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>JRB: Most importantly, we have more individual core contributors this cycle who truly believe in addressing accessibility issues. And they are all smart, wonderful people which makes working with them a pleasure!&lt;/p> &lt;p>For example, take &lt;a href="https://drupal.org/node/1811128">this issue about requirement warnings during installation&lt;/a>. For a sighted user, a warning during installation is immediately apparent. The missing requirement is made distinct with color contrast. For a blind user, they must traverse every cell in the table to discover a missing requirement. Would we ever impose such a burden on a sight user through the UI? No, not without grumbles in the issue queues at least. With more contributors invested in improving these types of non-visual details, we are polishing all the rough edges &amp;ndash; the ones we see &lt;em>and&lt;/em> the ones we don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: How important is context in aural interfaces?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>JRB: Context is important to all interfaces. As front end developers we build templates that expose context in a predictable, consumable way. As a practice we have established and then refined patterns of visual expression over the past 30-plus years.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Metaphors grounded visual pointer displays on a virtual desktop. We talk of visual affordances in rounded, gradient-embellished, reflective buttons. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">Skeumorphic designs&lt;/a> bring our understanding of the physical world to bear on pixels and bits.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Where are the metaphors in aural interface design? I know of none. To me, these interfaces are flat. The metal is bare underneath them.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Perhaps non-visual interfaces have one less level of abstraction to traverse. Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s no need to translate language into symbol and then back into language. But that little bit of designer in me, that memory of a linguist I almost was, remembers being thunderstruck with insight reading &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Jackendoff">Jackendoff&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> unfurling of metaphor after I had just so recently fallen smitten with the strict generative grammar of early &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky#Linguistic_theory">Chomsky&lt;/a>. Jackendoff gives us a way of understanding language that starts at basic physical dichotomies &amp;ndash; up/down and near/far &amp;ndash; and from there offers us a model of communication. He gives us pattern. (Early) Chomsky gave us metal. So much that we humans do starts with structure that softens with time to fit our curvy, winding nature.&lt;/p> &lt;p>I want to believe that the aural interfaces we have today still just the awkward first attempts to build an abstract audio interface pattern language. That non-visual interface design is still working through its &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_linguistics">structuralist&lt;/a> phase. We are still learning how to pack context into denser forms through non-visual expressions.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: Will the Drupal 8 improvements have things to offer module developers?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>JRB: In Drupal 8, we are building tools that manage a couple of the trickier components of accessibility in a browser. These are:&lt;/p> &lt;ol> &lt;li>Outputting audio updates&lt;/li> &lt;li>Managing tabbing in constrained workflows&lt;/li> &lt;/ol> &lt;p>Module developers will be able to pass a string to a method called &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>announce&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; on the Drupal object and have that string read by a screen reader.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Another method on the Drupal object called &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>tabbingManager&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; will constrain tabbable elements on the page. A developer will select those elements, either through JavaScript methods or jQuery, and pass them to the tabbingManager. Tabbing is then constrained to those elements until the constraint is superseded or released. I know that must not be completely clear, but that&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re presenting &lt;a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/node/2158.html">a session about aural user interfaces and how we can use these new tools to build them&lt;/a>!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Grow your own: Learning custom base themes at Drupalcon Portland</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/grow-your-own-learning-custom-base-themes-drupalcon-portland/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/grow-your-own-learning-custom-base-themes-drupalcon-portland/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ah, base themes.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>If there&amp;rsquo;s an analogue to the Windows/Mac/Linux battle in Drupal land, it&amp;rsquo;s probably &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/zen">Zen&lt;/a> vs. &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/omega">Omega&lt;/a> vs. &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/adaptivetheme">AdaptiveTheme&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Garrett Dawson&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>John Ferris&lt;/strong> have a way out of that eternal struggle: Custom base themes. As they put it in their &lt;a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/node/3043.html">Drupalcon Portland session description&lt;/a>:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>&amp;ldquo;By necessity, base themes make assumptions about how teams and individuals work. By rolling your own, you&amp;rsquo;ll become much more comfortable and informed about the Drupal theming layer, and have a better launchpad for your front-end projects.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>Here in Portland we take home gardening and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture">permaculture&lt;/a> seriously, so what better place to talk about &amp;ldquo;growing your own&amp;rdquo; custom base theme!&lt;/p> &lt;p>I spoke with John and Garrett about how creating your own base theme can make work for you and your team easier. &lt;a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/node/3043.html">&lt;strong>Take a gander at their session, &amp;ldquo;Dapper Drupal: Custom Tailored Themes,&amp;rdquo; on Thursday at 2:15 PM for the full story!&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>&lt;/p> &lt;hr> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: Base themes that are out there make some assumptions about how you want to theme. What&amp;rsquo;s the advantage to rolling your own base theme rather than finding the theme that already makes the assumptions you do?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>JF and GD: If you can find a base theme in contrib that fits perfectly into your workflow, by all means, use it. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of solid tools out there. We don&amp;rsquo;t want to deter people from using and contributing to them. With that said, we feel it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely a contributed base theme will be ticking all the boxes and making all the right assumptions about your workflow.&lt;/p> &lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all approach. Your front-end process is heavily influenced by team dynamics, contrib module choices and a whole host of other considerations. The majority of base themes cannot account for those variables like you can. We want front-end developers to take a critical look at their tools to see where they can make improvements. That may mean creating a custom base theme; a custom starter theme for use with an existing base theme; or even a set of helper modules.&lt;/p> &lt;p>All the popular base themes started because someone wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy with what was available at the time. The ultimate goal is increasing efficiency while improving the quality of the final HTML, CSS and JS.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: Do you recommend custom base themes for big shops? Small distributed teams? Freelancers? Everyone?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>JF/GD: Yes, all of the above. At least consider it as an option. If you find yourself doing any kind of repetitive work, there&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity for improvement. The only people who should steer clear of custom base themes are those new to Drupal. You need to be familiar with the tools that are available before setting out to create your own.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: Besides your the custom base themes you developed yourselves (&lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/center">Center&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/prototype">Prototype&lt;/a>) what other custom base themes have you seen in the wild?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>JF/GD: Yes! We&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot working with and iterating on Center and Prototype. They work well for the structure of our team and the type of work we do at &lt;a href="https://atendesigngroup.com/">Aten&lt;/a>. However, we realize every team is unique. We were really interested in seeing how other organizations were approaching the front-end problem space. We chatted with a range of teams of varying sizes working across different industries. Everyone has their own unique set of tools based on their own strengths and constraints. We&amp;rsquo;re excited to share those with you, but you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to come and see for yourself!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ninjas in your code at Drupalcon Portland: Sass with extends and placeholders</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-extends-placeholders/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-extends-placeholders/</guid><description>&lt;p> &lt;figure> &lt;picture> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-extends-placeholders/dsande-oocss.avif" type="image/avif"> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-extends-placeholders/dsande-oocss.webp" type="image/webp"> &lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="I&amp;amp;amp;rsquo;ve decided to update all the buttons" class="image_figure image_internal image_processed" width="720" height="279" src="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-extends-placeholders/dsande-oocss.png" title=" " /> &lt;/picture> &lt;/figure> &lt;/p> &lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that in the last year, adopting the CSS preprocessor &lt;a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass&lt;/a> has completely changed frontend development for me. That&amp;rsquo;s a sentiment I&amp;rsquo;ve heard others express when they started using it &amp;ndash; and I was pretty late to the party.&lt;/p> &lt;p>I got attracted to it initially through variables. We&amp;rsquo;ve all been there when a client or a designer wants to change a color and suddenly we have to change dozens or hundreds of values across CSS.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150919092337/http://www.dalesande.com/">Dale Sande&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> captures that kind of revolution in efficiency that Sass brings, as seen in a screenshot from &lt;a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/node/333.html">his upcoming presentation at Drupalcon Portland&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>But Dale, who&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/anotheruiguy">spoken plenty on Sass&lt;/a> and organizes the &lt;a data-dead-link="https://www.meetup.com/SASSlang/" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/dead-link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meetup.com%2FSASSlang%2F" title="https://www.meetup.com/SASSlang/ [dead link]" >Seattle Sass meetup&lt;/a >, is taking us way past the Sass basics like variables, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see his presentation next week.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Around the same time Sass came onto the scene, some thoughtful people were exploring more maintainable frontend development and CSS architecture through ideas/acronyms like &lt;strong>OOCSS&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>SMACSS&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>BEM&lt;/strong>, and folks like &lt;a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki">Nicole Sullivan&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://smacss.com/">Jonathan Snook&lt;/a> (a &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/world-class-frontend-track-drupalcon-portland">Drupalcon featured speaker!&lt;/a>), &lt;a href="https://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/">Nicolas Gallagher&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://cssguidelin.es/">Harry Roberts&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>I spoke with Dale about Sass, object-oriented CSS and some the things he&amp;rsquo;ll be covering at Drupalcon. &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/node/333.html">Be sure to join me at his session, &amp;ldquo;Sass: OO&amp;rsquo;S&amp;rsquo;CSS w/Extends and Silent Placeholders,&amp;rdquo; on Wednesday at 2:15 PM!&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;hr> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: Some people argue SASS creates bloated code &amp;ndash; do you see placeholders addressing that concern effectively?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>DS: Sass doesn&amp;rsquo;t create bad code. &lt;a href="https://thesassway.com/sass-doesnt-create-bad-code-bad-coders-do/">Bad coders do.&lt;/a>&lt;/p> &lt;p>The whole concept of &lt;a href="https://chriseppstein.github.io/blog/2012/08/23/sass-3-2-is-released/">placeholder selectors&lt;/a> was designed to fight code bloat and be a more pragmatic solution to OOCSS. In my presentation, I illustrate how using the various techniques generate code.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The real &amp;ldquo;ah-ha&amp;rdquo; moment comes when we see how using placeholder selectors makes it easier to manage and literally re-use code &amp;ndash; thus reducing dreaded CSS bloat.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>IB: What&amp;rsquo;s the advantage to using silent placeholders over mixins for a set of rules?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>DS: Simply put, being able to re-use code without duplicating code. The use of mixins was the first part of being &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY with our code&lt;/a>. Looking at the Sass it felt AWESOME! But when we looked at the output CSS, this is when we realized that we were all living a lie.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Our CSS rules were being duplicated tens, if not hundreds of times. We weren&amp;rsquo;t being DRY, we simply put the onus of duplication on the machine.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Placeholder selectors embrace the one of the oldest concepts of CSS and that is to extend the CSS selector for reuse. But with traditional CSS this was difficult to do, especially when you were dealing with thousands of lines of code. Sass&amp;rsquo; @extend directive allows developers to create name-spaced reusable chunks of code that is portable, re-usable and extendable without duplicating anything.&lt;/p> &lt;p> &lt;figure> &lt;picture> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-extends-placeholders/dsande-oocss2.avif" type="image/avif"> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-extends-placeholders/dsande-oocss2.webp" type="image/webp"> &lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Fighting tight coupling in CSS by keeping code separation in Sass ::legacy-float-r" class="image_figure image_internal image_processed" width="350" height="258" src="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-extends-placeholders/dsande-oocss2.png" /> &lt;/picture> &lt;/figure> &lt;strong>IB: Do you see placeholders as helping to reduce the amount of tight &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programming%29">coupling&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; scattering pieces of styles in multiple places?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>DS: While placeholder selectors are a tool that can help with scattered code, it is not the only solution.

If only charities were run more like businesses, he says &amp;ndash; with high executive pay and less belief in large &amp;ldquo;overhead&amp;rdquo; being a stand-in for inefficiency &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;d be able to do more.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Dan follows in the long tradition of successful businessmen (it&amp;rsquo;s almost always men) arriving on the nonprofit scene talking loudly and listening rarely.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>His ideas are wrong almost by design, because Dan isn&amp;rsquo;t interested in making nonprofits more powerful; he&amp;rsquo;s interested in making society more receptive to unrestrained business &amp;ndash; nonprofits, in this case, are merely a proxy.&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>He is not a credible defender of nonprofits&lt;/strong> because he doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to really care for them. He appears not to grasp the notion that markets fail&amp;ndash;and that one of nonprofits&amp;rsquo; primary roles is to address those failures, not mimic corporations. He has consistently disparaged nonprofits. In a &lt;em>Harvard Business Review&lt;/em> blog, he wrote that he&amp;rsquo;d be hard pressed to think of any business that wasn&amp;rsquo;t making more of a positive difference in society than nonprofits.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>&amp;ndash; &lt;a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/nonprofits-need-a-stronger-voice-but-not-from-the-wrong-messenger/">Phil Buchanan&lt;/a>, &lt;em>The Chronicle of Philanthropy&lt;/em>&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Just as he makes a fetish out of unrestrained capitalism&lt;/strong>, he makes a fetish out of cash over other means of securing happiness and satisfaction at work. How insulting to think that, if we make less pay than our for profit counterparts, we must be less creative, talented, intelligent and less capable of helping others.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>&amp;ndash; &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911224753/http://www.kenscommentary.org/2011/02/uncharitable-webinar-2-1-11.html">Ken Berger&lt;/a>, Charity Navigator&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>&lt;strong>The entire approach is based on the scarcity-model, zero-sum game that people like to play with charities.&lt;/strong> In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve referred to this as &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2010/12/google-chrome-cause-or-nonprofit-deathmatch-strikes-again">nonprofit deathmatch&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Yet lots of research has shown people who donate once are &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911224753/http://www.articlesbase.com/non-profit-organizations-articles/the-16-principles-of-personal-fundraising-influence-5204143.html">more likely&lt;/a> to &lt;a data-dead-link="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NARCDC/message/5757" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/dead-link/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgroups.yahoo.com%2Fgroup%2FNARCDC%2Fmessage%2F5757" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NARCDC/message/5757 [dead link]" >donate&lt;/a > &lt;a data-dead-link="https://twitter.com/MollyZerener/status/121363610214739968" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/dead-link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FMollyZerener%2Fstatus%2F121363610214739968" title="https://twitter.com/MollyZerener/status/121363610214739968 [dead link]" >again&lt;/a >, even to other organizations in the same field &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s why some nonprofits sell their lists.

But they&amp;rsquo;re all just the &amp;ldquo;nonprofit sector&amp;rdquo; to him.&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>To Mr. Pallotta, it&amp;rsquo;s the total amount of funds raised that is the ultimate measure.&lt;/strong> His defense of CEO pay justifies compensation in the context of revenue, apparently assuming that a charity that has more money will inevitably get better results.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>&amp;ndash; &lt;a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/nonprofits-need-a-stronger-voice-but-not-from-the-wrong-messenger/">Phil Buchanan&lt;/a>, &lt;em>The Chronicle of Philanthropy&lt;/em>&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Myth #1: There are $400,000 talents.&lt;/strong> The first falsehood is that there are people who are just worth more. Defending wide &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/growingunequalincomedistributionandpovertyinoecdcountries.htm">inequality&lt;/a> relies upon the notion that some people are worth much more, based on training, ability, or certain special qualities. This notion makes inequality appear legitimate to people at all levels, and thereby harder to redress. The use of the phrase &amp;rsquo;low-wage worker,&amp;rsquo; instead of &amp;lsquo;worker who is paid a low wage,&amp;rsquo; hints at a peculiarly American sleight of hand: Someone&amp;rsquo;s place in the wage structure is an indicator of their true merit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>&amp;ndash; &lt;a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/persistent_poverty_in_a_smug_meritocracy">Michelle Kweder, Gerald Denis, and Maureen Scully&lt;/a>, Stanford Social Innovation Review&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Dan also has little use for any vision of social change, or any apparent understanding of social movements&lt;/strong>, since none that could be called successful have in any way fit his vision.

But nonprofits, either because of a need for transparency or a lack of knowledge about the service, often have their official mailing address listed.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Domain Registry of America isn&amp;rsquo;t any kind of official or government-sanctioned company (I&amp;rsquo;ve intentionally refrained from referring to it as &lt;em>the&lt;/em> Domain Registry of America), although that&amp;rsquo;s clearly the impression they&amp;rsquo;re aiming for with their name.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>When a harried nonprofit staffer gets a letter that says &amp;ldquo;domain name expiration notice&amp;rdquo; in big letters at the top, they might well think back to the last time their website unexpectedly expired and send back their &amp;ldquo;renewal&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; not realizing they&amp;rsquo;ve unintentionally transferred their domain.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Now to be fair, Domain Registry of America carefully words its documents to specify that this &amp;ldquo;is not a bill&amp;rdquo; and that responding will &amp;ldquo;switch your domain name registration.&amp;rdquo; But they&amp;rsquo;re clearly banking on people not reading closely.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Domain Registry of America &lt;em>vastly&lt;/em> overcharges for domain registrations &amp;ndash; $35 per year with their &amp;ldquo;service,&amp;rdquo; whereas reputable registrars usually charge between $10 and $15 per year.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>This company can&amp;rsquo;t compete on price or service; their entire business model is built on swindling people into switching their registration. Because nonprofits are more likely to be low-information customers in this space, and because they&amp;rsquo;re likely to have their real contact information listed, nonprofits are at particular risk of being exploited by Domain Registry of America. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen at least two nonprofits nearly go through with the switch before they realized what was happening.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t let it happen to your nonprofit.

Here are the descriptions for both tracks:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;h3 id="frontend-connecting-new-tools-and-techniques-to-create-an-effective-drupal-frontend-experiencehttpsportland2013drupalorgprogramtracksfrontend" class="link_owner">&lt;span>&lt;a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/tracks/#frontend">Frontend: Connecting new tools and techniques to create an effective Drupal frontend experience&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The frontend experience of a website is crucial to its success. Though the backend of a site may be impeccable, the frontend experience gives the user the first impression of an organization or company. Without a good frontend experience, a site can turn users away. Let&amp;rsquo;s discover ways in which we can connect our knowledge of different frontend tools and techniques with Drupal &amp;ndash; and make Drupal a better experience for all users.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Main Themes&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;ul> &lt;li>The importance of frontend development in creating websites + web apps&lt;/li> &lt;li>What frontend developers need to know to work well with backend devs, PMs, UX, Content Strategists&lt;/li> &lt;li>Preparing frontend devs for D8 and Twig&lt;/li> &lt;li>Frontend for mobile&lt;/li> &lt;li>Using frontend frameworks such as Foundation and Bootstrap&lt;/li> &lt;li>Speeding up the design process&lt;/li> &lt;li>Frontend development for multilingual sites&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Audience&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;ul> &lt;li>Frontend developers&lt;/li> &lt;li>Backend devs that do Frontend work&lt;/li> &lt;li>PMs that work with Frontend devs&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;blockquote> &lt;h3 id="user-experience-uxhttpsportland2013drupalorgprogramtracksux" class="link_owner">&lt;span>&lt;a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/program/tracks/#UX">User Experience (UX)&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The User Experience process is key to the success of the development of websites and web applications. From user research, interviews and analytics, we learn what the user actually wants and needs; not what we assume they want. At this year&amp;rsquo;s DrupalCon we present a new User Experience track to show our community&amp;rsquo;s dedication to user needs.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Main Themes&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;ul> &lt;li>Explaining what user experience is and why it&amp;rsquo;s important&lt;/li> &lt;li>UX for mobile and tablet, Responsive UX&lt;/li> &lt;li>Speeding up the design process using UX tools and techniques&lt;/li> &lt;li>UX for multilingual sites - especially RTL&lt;/li> &lt;li>Content Strategy&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Audience&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;ul> &lt;li>UX professionals - Drupal&lt;/li> &lt;li>UX professionals outside of Drupal&lt;/li> &lt;li>Backend devs that are interested in UX&lt;/li> &lt;li>Frontend devs interested in UX&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>For the frontend track, global track chair John Ferris and I are looking for balance among three big areas: CSS and CSS metalanguages like Sass and LESS; jQuery and JavaScript; and Drupal 8&amp;rsquo;s new template engine, Twig.

For individuals already on Facebook, it can compile a detailed profile of you around the web, based on what you visit (again, whether or not you click the button) and serve you or your friends particular ads on Facebook as a result. For those who are not on Facebook, or who aren&amp;rsquo;t logged in, it can still tie the profile to your IP address, and could theoretically link that information to you, should you subsequently show up on Facebook.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="this-isnt-unique-to-facebook" class="link_owner">&lt;span>This isn&amp;rsquo;t unique to Facebook&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Most &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; third-party apps do exactly the same thing, although few have the reach of Facebook. The other big player is &lt;strong>Google&lt;/strong>, who tracks you (by IP address) using Google Analytics, which many websites have installed in exchange for free website statistics, and tracks you (by Google profile) using Google&amp;rsquo;s new &amp;ldquo;+1&amp;rdquo; button released as part of the Google Plus social network. Since Google makes so much of its money from advertising, its interest in knowing which sites you visit is pretty self-explanatory.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Other social networks&amp;rsquo; widgets, such as Twitter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Tweet&amp;rdquo; button, the Pinterest button, etc. also are certainly tracking who is accessing them, but to date there have been fewer examples of them using this information to build profiles of people. Social &amp;ldquo;plugin&amp;rdquo; applications, like AddThis, ShareThis and Disqus also compile profiles of people as a way to present them what they think will be the most useful social network buttons (and in some cases links to other content), but it&amp;rsquo;s less clear whether they&amp;rsquo;ve been using that information for any other purposes.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Organizations concerned about the privacy of their visitors &amp;ndash; &lt;strong>especially those at risk of being tracked by repressive governments who could lean on social networking companies to release user data&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; should carefully weigh whether a given social widget is worth the risk in privacy. Moreover, these organizations should absolutely provide a privacy policy that specifically lays out what&amp;rsquo;s being collected and by whom, and may also want to consider suggesting ways for those at risk to circumvent this data tracking.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Several organizations I&amp;rsquo;ve seen have prominently linked to the &lt;a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project&lt;/a>, and there are good resources from the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/blog-safely">EFF&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910225919/https://ethanzuckerman.com/2006/10/01/anonymous-blogging-with-wordpress-and-tor/">Ethan Zuckerman&lt;/a> on using Tor for anonymous blogging.

Business profiles, like Facebook Pages, are likely coming in the future. In the meantime you could try to circumvent this by creating a &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo; with the name of an organization, but just like with Facebook, that &lt;a href="https://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2007/08/free-ranger-ric.html">risks having your profile deleted&lt;/a>. (More on that in a moment.)&lt;/p> &lt;p>One positive aspect of this is that it gets easier to organize among people you know. Until now, social networks have basically had two models: Public profiles that don&amp;rsquo;t require real names, like MySpace and Twitter, and private profiles that do require real names, like Facebook.&lt;/p> &lt;p>With Google Plus, profiles are both public and under people&amp;rsquo;s real names, meaning that if you have a list of donors, supporters or volunteers you could conceivably find each one who has a Google Plus profile relatively easily. (LinkedIn has a similar setup, but is largely used for job-seeking and, unlike Google Plus, requires an account in order to see profiles &amp;ndash; so at best they are only semi-public.)&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="professionalizing-communications" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Professionalizing communications&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">The Cathedral &amp;amp; the Bazaar&lt;/a>&lt;/em> you&amp;rsquo;ll recognize the concepts of formal and informal communication.

Researcher danah boyd has gone so far as to call Google Plus&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;nymwars&amp;rdquo; policy &lt;a href="https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2011/08/04/real-names.html">&amp;ldquo;an abuse of power&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>The people who most heavily rely on pseudonyms in online spaces are those who are most marginalized by systems of power. &amp;ldquo;Real names&amp;rdquo; policies aren&amp;rsquo;t empowering; they&amp;rsquo;re an authoritarian assertion of power over vulnerable people.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>The Geek Feminism Wiki has an extensive entry on &lt;a href="https://geekfeminism.fandom.com/wiki/Who_is_harmed_by_a_%22Real_Names%22_policy%3F">who is harmed by &amp;ldquo;real names&amp;rdquo; policies&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Second is the loss of creativity &amp;ndash; and creative activism&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; when we demand that people tie their writings to a legal identity. (Boyd points out that somehow Facebook&amp;rsquo;s strict policy on real names has never required Lady Gaga to identify as Stefani Germanotta.)&lt;/p> &lt;p>In the context of social movements, we sometimes remember organizers through real names (Martin Luther King, Jr.; Mohandas Gandhi) but often we know them through names other than what might have been their legal identity: Malcolm X, Mother Jones, Sylvia Rivera, or Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Ross and known throughout her work as &amp;ldquo;Moses&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p> &lt;p>Activists often use &amp;ldquo;movement names&amp;rdquo; of one type or another, like the Chinese pro-democracy activist Michael Anti, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2011/03/08/facebook-closes-china-activists-account-for-pseudonym.html">recently deleted under Facebook&amp;rsquo;s policy&lt;/a>. Jillian C. York points out at the EFF that &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/case-pseudonyms">successful online organizing is often done under a kind of group pseudonym&lt;/a>, as with the Egyptian uprising originating in posts on the &amp;ldquo;We Are All Khaled Said&amp;rdquo; Facebook page. And of course the use of &amp;ldquo;handles&amp;rdquo; online is older than the Web itself &amp;ndash; arguably older than the Internet, if you consider communication tools like ham radio.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Some of us would argue that far from being an &amp;ldquo;error&amp;rdquo; as Google&amp;rsquo;s Schmidt would have it, online use of pseudonymous, anonymous, temporary, artistic, or otherwise &amp;ldquo;unofficial&amp;rdquo; identities has been a core reason for the Internet&amp;rsquo;s growth and strength. So if this does represent a broader shift toward identity-focused social networks, activists will need to adapt and, in some cases, circumvent these policies.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;em>Update, Oct. 5, 2015: The EFF has launched an initiative called &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/global-coalition-facebook-authentic-names-are-authentically-dangerous-your-users">The Nameless Coalition&lt;/a>, calling on all social networks to step back from &amp;ldquo;real name&amp;rdquo; policies.&lt;/em>&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="google-plus-hangouts" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Google Plus Hangouts&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In addition to Google Plus profiles, Google has launched a new video-chatting system called Google+ Hangouts. This could be useful to online organizers both for quick collaboration with colleagues and for impromptu webinars with supporters. Although there are participation limits, for small groups this offers a welcome no-cost alternative to platforms like WebEx or GoToMeeting.&lt;/p> &lt;p> &lt;figure> &lt;picture> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2011/08/google-plus-nonprofit-social-change-implications/2011-08-05_phlnet2_google-plus-12.avif" type="image/avif"> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2011/08/google-plus-nonprofit-social-change-implications/2011-08-05_phlnet2_google-plus-12.webp" type="image/webp"> &lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Impromptu webinars with supporters" class="image_figure image_internal image_processed" width="792" height="612" src="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2011/08/google-plus-nonprofit-social-change-implications/2011-08-05_phlnet2_google-plus-12.jpg" title=" " /> &lt;/picture> &lt;/figure> &lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="conclusion" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Conclusion&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Whenever I talk about online organizing, I emphasize that it&amp;rsquo;s important to &lt;strong>go where your people are&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p> &lt;p> &lt;figure> &lt;picture> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2011/08/google-plus-nonprofit-social-change-implications/2011-08-05_phlnet2_google-plus-13.avif" type="image/avif"> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2011/08/google-plus-nonprofit-social-change-implications/2011-08-05_phlnet2_google-plus-13.webp" type="image/webp"> &lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Go where your people are" class="image_figure image_internal image_processed" width="792" height="612" src="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2011/08/google-plus-nonprofit-social-change-implications/2011-08-05_phlnet2_google-plus-13.jpg" title=" " /> &lt;/picture> &lt;/figure> &lt;/p> &lt;p>There are aspects of every social network I like and don&amp;rsquo;t like, as an organizer and as a participant.

And it&amp;rsquo;s nice that on the Chrome for a Cause page, they have links to &amp;ldquo;donate directly&amp;rdquo; under the description of each organization.&lt;/p> &lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also nice that people who participate in Chrome for a Cause get to choose &amp;ndash; from Google&amp;rsquo;s list of five charities &amp;ndash; where they want their portion of the money generated to go.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="what-im-less-thrilled-about" class="link_owner">&lt;span>What I&amp;rsquo;m less thrilled about&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>The cleverness of it is lost on me.&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll donate money for every tab you open, if you download an extension for it,&amp;rdquo; seems like if a car dealer said, &amp;ldquo;Hey, for the month of December, every time you open the back left door of your car, I&amp;rsquo;ll donate 10 cents to a charity that you choose. (But you have to come in to the dealership to get a counter installed on that door.)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>I get that it&amp;rsquo;s tied to the use of the browser, and anything that gets people to use the browser more (and set up Google accounts if they don&amp;rsquo;t have them) is a plus for them. So it makes sense for &lt;em>Google&lt;/em> to put the tabs-for-charity schtick on this project, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see how it makes any kind of sense at all to the public. Which leads me to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>It feels creepy that Google is exploiting the holiday season of goodwill to get more usage out of its browser.&lt;/strong> I know that corporations don&amp;rsquo;t make donations to nonprofits without getting something in return, but this seems more gratuitous than usual. And, of course, it could breed the ultimate form of &amp;ldquo;slacktivism&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; ineffective digital activism &amp;ndash; in which opening a tab to donate a few cents assuages a person&amp;rsquo;s sense of needing to contribute to making the world a better place.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Not even a glancing mention on their page of how much is donated for each tab.&lt;/strong> Once you download the extension, it calculates how much your tabs have donated so far, in things rather than dollars (e.g. 0.3 trees; the full breakdown is &lt;a href="https://chrome.googleblog.com/2010/12/browse-for-good-cause.html" title="Read Google's blog entry describing Chrome for a Cause">on their blog&lt;/a>), so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to know exactly how much each tab is worth in monetary terms. But even measuring it in what it will buy, why should we have to install the extension in order to find out what our possible impact will be?&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>It promotes the idea of organizational competition &amp;ndash; the nonprofit deathmatch.&lt;/strong> Take a look at the screenshot above: You can &lt;em>either&lt;/em> donate 9 vaccinations, &lt;em>or&lt;/em> 23 books, &lt;em>or&lt;/em> one person&amp;rsquo;s clean water. I know that these kinds of competitions are all the rage &amp;ndash; they even have a name, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911000054/http://www.moderngiving.com/2009/07/crowdsourcing-philanthropy-greater-transparency/" title="About crowdsourcing philanthropy on Modern Giving">crowdsourcing&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101009111313/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/kindness/post/2009/11/innovative-crowdsourcing-philanthropy-contest-launches-on-facebook-today-with-5-million-in-total-winnings/1" title="News report on the crowdsourced Chase Community Giving on Facebook">philanthropy&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; but it&amp;rsquo;s frustrating to me how it&amp;rsquo;s rooted in a scarcity model, in which organizations must compete rather than collaborate. I&amp;rsquo;m sure, for instance, that each of these nonprofits is encouraging their members to &amp;ldquo;donate tabs&amp;rdquo; to them, rather than others.&lt;/p> &lt;p>In fact, since Google has capped its donation at $1 million, and it&amp;rsquo;s relatively certain they will reach that amount given their reach, what participants are really voting for is allocation. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve got a million dollars; vote with your tabs on what percentage should go to The Nature Conservancy,&amp;rdquo; they&amp;rsquo;re saying. So every vote to one organization takes money away from another.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="how-it-could-be-better" class="link_owner">&lt;span>How it could be better&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Be transparent about what the impact is.&lt;/strong> Google should say, on the Chrome for Cause page itself, how many tabs you have to open to plant a tree (for instance).&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Integrate concrete actions from the charities.&lt;/strong> Doctors Without Borders doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>just&lt;/em> ask people for money &amp;ndash; they have, for instance, a big campaign to pressure governments &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100702205106/http://www.msfaccess.org:80/" title="Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines">not to prevent affordable generic medicines&lt;/a> from being exported to the Global South, and another advocating for &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110218075603/http://www.starvedforattention.org/take-action.php" title="Starved for Attention">humanitarian food aid that provides adequate nutrition&lt;/a>. At the end of each day, when a person submits their votes, why not end with something like &amp;ldquo;Great! Now here are more things you can do to support this charity&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Pick one charity each week/month/season.&lt;/strong> This might be a little controversial, since more exposure for more nonprofits seems like a good thing, and part of this project&amp;rsquo;s appeal is the ability for people to pick where their money goes. But by acting as a kind of &amp;ldquo;matching grant&amp;rdquo; for a nonprofit &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll donate $1 million to this organization, if our users open at least 1 million tabs this week&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Google can generate exposure for the organization and its browser, without forcing groups into the boxing ring against one another.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Pick one &lt;em>charity field&lt;/em> each week/month/season.&lt;/strong> Instead of choosing a single environmental group for its donation, Google could choose to donate money equally to five or ten nonprofits in the same sector. This would encourage collaboration between nonprofits working on the same issue to work together in asking their supporters to participate.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Support nonprofits year-round.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s cute that Google is donating some money in December, to (sort of) coincide with the holidays, but there&amp;rsquo;s no reason they can&amp;rsquo;t do this for longer than a week. By making it an ongoing project and cycling through different organizations, Google can donate money to nonprofits, but also give its far more lucrative asset: attention.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>What are your thoughts on Chrome for a Cause?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Facebook removes default landing tab for new nonprofit pages</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2010/12/facebook-removes-default-landing-tab-new-nonprofit-pages/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2010/12/facebook-removes-default-landing-tab-new-nonprofit-pages/</guid><description>&lt;p> &lt;figure> &lt;picture> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2010/12/facebook-removes-default-landing-tab-new-nonprofit-pages/fb-no-default-tabs.avif" type="image/avif"> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2010/12/facebook-removes-default-landing-tab-new-nonprofit-pages/fb-no-default-tabs.webp" type="image/webp"> &lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Old Facebook Pages vs. new Facebook Pages" class="image_figure image_internal image_processed" width="720" height="216" src="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2010/12/facebook-removes-default-landing-tab-new-nonprofit-pages/fb-no-default-tabs.png" title=" " /> &lt;/picture> &lt;/figure> &lt;/p> &lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re a nonprofit with a mailing address, you may have already received the card in the mail from Facebook: An invitation to claim your organization&amp;rsquo;s Facebook Places page. &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/places" title="Visit Facebook Places' home page">Facebook Places&lt;/a> allows people to &amp;ldquo;check in&amp;rdquo; when they&amp;rsquo;re at your organization, publicizing you to their friends. Places also allows companies to offer &amp;ldquo;deals&amp;rdquo; to people who check in (like 10% off), although how that applies to a nonprofit is less clear.&lt;/p> &lt;p>If you already had a Facebook Page, when you go to claim your Facebook Place, you&amp;rsquo;ll be prompted to merge the two.&lt;/p> &lt;p>This new, merged page will look a little different from your old page. Among other differences, what were formerly tabs across the top of your page will now be links underneath your profile picture, similar to the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110826093738/http://www.johnhaydon.com/2010/12/new-and-improved-facebook-profiles-a-screen-shot-tour/" title="View a walk-through of the new Facebook Profiles from John Haydon">new Facebook Profiles&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>And that&amp;rsquo;s where the trouble starts: On your new merged Facebook Page &amp;ndash; as the picture above shows &amp;ndash; you will no longer be able to specify a default landing tab.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Default landing tabs are a powerful way to &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110826093738/http://fblandingtabs.wikispaces.com/Nonprofitexamples" title="View a slideshow on creating default landing tabs by Debra Askanase">convert visitors to fans&lt;/a>. Instead of new visitors simply being dumped on your Wall, nonprofits (and other companies) could create custom tabs, welcoming new visitors, introducing them to the organization, and encouraging them to &amp;ldquo;Like&amp;rdquo; the nonprofit.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Earlier this year, Facebook announced they were &lt;a data-dead-link="http://www.facebook.com/posted.php?id=212577490407&amp;amp;share_id=112272642162634&amp;amp;comments=1#s112272642162634" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/dead-link/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fposted.php%3Fid%3D212577490407%26share_id%3D112272642162634%26comments%3D1%23s112272642162634" title="Read Beth Kanter&amp;#39;s discussion about this change on Facebook [dead link]" >dropping support for new custom tabs that used Facebook Markup Language (FBML)&lt;/a >, although you could still specify a particular application tab as your landing page, including &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110826093738/http://savedelete.com/how-to-create-impressive-welcome-page-for-your-facebook-fan-page-absolutely-free.html" title="A guide to creating custom landing tabs from SaveDelete blog">custom-page-creating applications&lt;/a>. Indeed, a custom landing tab was recommended as a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110826093738/http://www.diosacommunications.com/facebookbestpractices.htm#19" title="Read the Facebook best practices for nonprofits">Facebook best practice&lt;/a> for nonprofits.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Now, however, it appears all visitors to a nonprofit&amp;rsquo;s Facebook Page will be directed to the Wall. What&amp;rsquo;s more, with tabs being de-emphasized by their move to smaller links under your profile, it&amp;rsquo;s less obvious how new visitors can find out more about your organization.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Since at the moment this only appears to affect Places pages, and any existing Pages merged with a Place, it&amp;rsquo;s unclear whether this is simply a roll-out bug or something more long-term. But given that Facebook &lt;a href="https://nonprofitorgs.wordpress.com/2009/12/13/attn-nonprofits-major-changes-coming-soon-to-facebook-fan-pages/" title="Read about the changes to the Pages and Profiles over time, by Heather Mansfield">first removed the default landing tab a few months ago&lt;/a>, reinstating it after an uproar &amp;ndash; but only &amp;ldquo;temporarily&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; I would guess that this is the direction of things on Facebook.&lt;/p> &lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s possible that this might only apply to pages in some categories, e.g. nonprofits but not companies; I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to any company Facebook pages to investigate this on. It appears a default landing tab has &lt;a data-dead-link="http://www.facebook.com/help/#%21/help/?question=87334" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/dead-link/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F%23%2521%2Fhelp%2F%3Fquestion%3D87334" title="Read Facebook&amp;#39;s help topic on default landing tabs and Community Pages [dead link]" >never been available&lt;/a > on things categorized as Community Pages &amp;ndash; initially auto-generated from interests listed on profiles.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>It appears that default landing tabs are not available on Places pages &amp;ndash; or any traditional Pages &amp;ldquo;merged&amp;rdquo; with Places. My prediction is that it won&amp;rsquo;t stick around for the rest of the Pages on Facebook.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not clear to me what the advantage of this is to Facebook, other than a general &amp;ldquo;standardness of experience&amp;rdquo; for users. Yet without any way to (substantially) customize the Wall, this seems like a net loss for both organizations and regular users. New visitors will no longer have an easy way to be introduced to an organization, and organizations will have to carefully cultivate their Wall to &amp;ndash; at any moment &amp;ndash; appeal to both current fans and new visitors.&lt;/p> &lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what possible solutions out there, although one might be to make sure your Page&amp;rsquo;s image/logo quickly communicates exactly what your nonprofit is about.&lt;/p> &lt;p>What are your thoughts on these changes to Facebook?&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;em>Note: If you blog about this, feel free to re-use the image above, with credit.

Blame sexism.</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2010/08/too-few-women-tech-blame-sexism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2010/08/too-few-women-tech-blame-sexism/</guid><description>&lt;p>Michael Arrington has a &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/28/women-in-tech-stop-blaming-me/">tedious post on TechCrunch&lt;/a> up about the fact that there aren&amp;rsquo;t as many women in technology, or &amp;ndash; more to the point &amp;ndash; in positions of leadership in technology companies or on panels at tech conferences isn&amp;rsquo;t men&amp;rsquo;s fault.&lt;/p> &lt;p>But you know what? I think he&amp;rsquo;s right.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Men aren&amp;rsquo;t to blame for the lack of representation by women in technology. Nor, clearly, are women to blame. What causes this disparity? One word: Sexism.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>&amp;ldquo;But wait!&amp;rdquo; you cry. &amp;ldquo;Surely there must be someone &lt;em>carrying out&lt;/em> this sexism.&amp;rdquo; And indeed, that&amp;rsquo;s true &amp;ndash; many individual men, and some women, often put forth ideas or enact policies that are rooted in sexism.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>But sexism is bigger than any one person; it&amp;rsquo;s a system in which our entire society &amp;ndash; certainly the privileged, Western technology community &amp;ndash; is enmeshed.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Too often, such systematic discrimination as treated as discrete, individual acts, disconnected from the larger reality. And so Arrington can complain:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>Every damn time we have a conference we fret over how we can find women to fill speaking slots.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>By attempting to fill a quota, he thinks he can inoculate himself (or his conference) against the charge of sexism. (He then makes the absurd point that, really, women are getting annoyed by being asked to speak at conferences all the time &amp;ndash; which tends to undo that inoculation a small bit.)&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Men are privileged most directly by sexism, of course, which is why Arrington&amp;rsquo;s post is so galling.&lt;/strong> He suggests &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; need women &amp;ldquo;who go out and start companies&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;complain about how there are too few women in tech,&amp;rdquo; as if justice in the technology community and the larger society is only the job of those who are marginalized, and never the ones who hold power.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Part of this is due to the retreat from full-fledged feminism into what Tim Wise has called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.timwise.org/1999/12/springing-the-diversity-trap-thoughts-on-how-not-to-defend-affirmative-action/">the diversity trap&lt;/a>,&amp;rdquo; in which a commitment only to &amp;ldquo;different backgrounds&amp;rdquo; motivates any kind of diversity. He&amp;rsquo;s writing about racism and affirmative action, but the movement is the same &amp;ndash; away from working to end sexism or racism, and toward an anodyne pledge to provide different perspectives. Wise quotes then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan, upon signing affirmative action into law in 1974:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>Time and experience have shown that laws and edicts of non-discrimination are not enough. Justice demands that each and every citizen consciously adopt and accentuate a commitment to affirmative action, which will make equal opportunity a reality.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Providing opportunity alone won&amp;rsquo;t work when the playing field is already tilted. Simply inviting speakers from a field from which women have been systematically filtered since birth is too late in the game.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Arrington makes the mind-boggling assertion that women are at an advantage, because there are so few of them that the press wants to write about the ones who &amp;ldquo;make it.&amp;rdquo; This is the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/the-talented-tenth/">talented tenth&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; turned on its head &amp;ndash; that because &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/section/women-in-tech-2009">a few individuals&lt;/a> have struggled against overwhelming odds toward success, and that the media naturally wants to cover such extraordinary stories, the institutional oppression that existed to make those stories exceptional in the first place somehow disappears. As the death threats against tech writer &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/TECH-CHRONICLES-A-daily-dose-of-postings-from-2567591.php">Kathy Sierra&lt;/a> demonstrated, straight-up sexism still holds sway among large parts of this male-domainted field.&lt;/p> &lt;p>In the sub-field of nonprofit technology, many if not most of the people I look to are women: &lt;a href="https://bethkanter.org/">Beth Kanter&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://amysampleward.org/">Amy Sample Ward&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://zenofnptech.org/">Michelle Murrain&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.alexandrasamuel.com/">Alexandra Samuel&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://ext337.org/">Marnie Webb&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://www.frogloop.com/care2blog/author/radcampaign">Allyson Kapin&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://blog.deborah.elizabeth.finn.com/">Deborah Elizabeth Finn&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://afine2.wordpress.com/">Allison Fine&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://www.communityorganizer20.com/">Debra Askanase&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://mobileactive.org/blog/katrinverclas">Katrin Verclas&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://brittbravo.com/">Britt Bravo&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://www.idealware.org/blogs/laura-quinn">Laura Quinn&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://zapboom.com/">Mary Joyce&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://twitter.com/ntenhross">Holly Ross&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://www.marketingfornonprofits.org/">Jocelyn Harmon&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://cariegrls.blogspot.com/">Carie Lewis&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://rjleaman.com/">Rebecca Leaman&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.slideshare.net/danielle.brigida">Danielle Brigida&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://my.socialactions.com/profile/ChristineEgger">Christine Egger&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://www.diosacommunications.com/bio.htm">Heather Mansfield&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://www.shireenmitchell.com/">Shireen Mitchell&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101006043025/http://gettingattention.org/">Nancy Schwartz&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://lotusmedia.org/">Ruby Sinreich&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/suzboop">Susan Tenby&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/">danah boyd&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110810123207/http://techpresident.com:80/blog/nancy_scola">Nancy Scola&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.nonprofitmarketingguide.com/history/">Kivi Leroux Miller&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://neworganizing.com/about/staff/leadership-senior-fellows/judith-freeman/">Judith Freeman&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/https://www.antharia.com/staff/details.php?id=2">Jordan Dossett&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101126090250/http://mixergy.com/roz-lemieux-fission-strategy/">Roz Lemieux&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wharman">Wendy Harman&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110205002513/http://www.beaconfire.com/About-Beaconfire/People#peoplebrowser">Eve Simon&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://www.mad-tech.org/forum/topic/listForContributor?user=2ge752rigtexq">Alnisa Allgood&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://nurture.biz/">Jean Russell&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://exchange.causes.com/?s=%22susan+gordon%22">Susan Gordon&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://www.nonprofitmarketingblog.com/">Katya Andresen&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://www.socialfish.org/blog">Maddie Grant&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.grandjunctiondesign.com/">Margaux O&amp;rsquo;Malley&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s just off the top of my head (sorry if I missed anyone).&lt;/p> &lt;p>Yet even in this space, women leaders are repeatedly &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://netsquared.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=118511">judged on their appearance&lt;/a>. In the nonprofit field as a whole, despite there being more women than men in leadership, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100825172812/http://www.nptimes.com/Feb03/sr1.html">they&amp;rsquo;re still paid less&lt;/a> across the board, although the gap is &lt;a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/gap-grows-in-salaries-for-ceos-study-finds/">slowly shrinking&lt;/a>. In part this may explain the success of women in this field, as any kind of &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100902160446/http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/08/10/majors">social work&lt;/a> is seen as &lt;a href="https://island94.org/2009/10/Social-work-is-womens-work-so-we-dont-care.html">women&amp;rsquo;s work&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Arrington is feeling put-upon because he&amp;rsquo;s experiencing women who point out the inequity in representation and leadership as a personal attack on him. It&amp;rsquo;s not that unusual of a response &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s the same experience white folks have when people of color talk about racism, straight people have when queers demand equal treatment, and able-bodied individuals have when persons with disabilities expect equal access.&lt;/p> &lt;p>This is how oppression is set up &amp;ndash; forcing individuals to compete against one another &lt;em>as individuals&lt;/em> and rendering its pervasive influence invisible.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Michael Arrington is right to be outraged. But the outrage should be focused on the sexism that keeps both men &lt;em>and&lt;/em> women down.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>While it&amp;rsquo;s women who bear the overwhelming amount of oppression from sexism, it&amp;rsquo;s a force that inhibits men&amp;rsquo;s growth as well. Men are expected to take on unbelievable obstacles, toil without complaint and settle for stunted emotional connections to family and friends.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Many successful men, when confronted with evidence of institutionalized sexism, feel that their accomplishments are being degraded, because they had to struggle mightily under such harsh conditions.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>What too many men miss is the reality that the system under which they face such inhumane expectations is the &lt;em>same one&lt;/em> that limits the potential of women.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Of course, there are individual men and women who help to support such a system. Their actions are rightly be identified and they should be given the support and resources to help to change these actions. But changing individual actions isn&amp;rsquo;t enough by itself &amp;ndash; the system must be confronted as a whole.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.blogher.com/">BlogHer&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://womenwhotech.org/">Women Who Tech&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://shesgeeky.org/">She&amp;rsquo;s Geeky&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://webgrrls.com/">WebGrrls&lt;/a> conferences are one component, as a place for women to strategize and support one another; continually pressing for more visibility for women at tech conferences dominated by men who are &lt;a href="https://surfette.typepad.com/blogher/2005/11/do_women_warm_t.html">simply unaware of women techies&lt;/a> is another component.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>What would be even more exciting? A conference of male-identified folks interested in supporting women who take on positions of leadership in the tech community.&lt;/strong> Part of that involves men looking at what gets in the way of them supporting more women in &amp;ldquo;their&amp;rdquo; space, and men working through that might not always look pretty to women. But belittling women who point out systematic inequities as Arrington does is a reactionary response to being asked to account for one&amp;rsquo;s privilege.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>This needs to be an effort undertaken by both women and men, not for some vague goal of &amp;ldquo;diverse voices&amp;rdquo; but as a way to realize all of our potentials in technology and beyond.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Updates:&lt;/strong> Allyson Kapin has a &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1685780/too-few-women-tech-stop-playing-blame-game">great list of specific suggestions&lt;/a> to address this issue, and Michael Arrington followed up by saying he knows more needs to be done, but he might delete the post in favor of something &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/arrington/status/22454841699">far less painful&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s likely that to really address sexism &amp;ndash; if that is what he wants to do &amp;ndash; he&amp;rsquo;ll have to face some painful truths, however. Jon Pincus says it much more succinctly: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.talesfromthe.net/jon/?p=1552">Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s hard. Take some responsibility.&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;em>P.S.

And that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m covering today at the &lt;a href="https://www.nten.org/ntc/">2010 Nonprofit Technology Conference&lt;/a>, along with &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120204213748/http://www.communityorganizer20.com/">Debra Askanase&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://amysampleward.org/">Amy Sample Ward&lt;/a>, in a session called &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100713125922/https://www.ntenonline.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?webcode=SessionDetails&amp;amp;ses_key=9e27f6a5-1720-4ad1-8ee0-058a2260bcbb">Bringing Community Organizing Into Online Campaigns&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="what-i-mean-by-community-organizing" class="link_owner">&lt;span>What I mean by community organizing&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The idea of community organizing has always been weighted with both political implications and social context, and so one person&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of what &amp;ldquo;counts&amp;rdquo; as community organizing &amp;ndash; and what its implications are &amp;ndash; will vary from the next.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>For my purposes here, I&amp;rsquo;m using community organizing as the idea that individuals have more power to create change by coming together than by acting alone. Community organizing empowers these individuals, creates long-term change and challenges the structure of power.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Previously I&amp;rsquo;ve argued that with the rise of &amp;ldquo;web 2.0,&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/09/gurus-are-not-enough-call-organizers-organizing-social-media">everybody is learning how to be a community organizer&lt;/a>. The principles of how to mobilize friends and neighbors around a particular issue &amp;ndash; whether it&amp;rsquo;s a social cause or a hot party &amp;ndash; are being learned every time someone creates a Facebook event.&lt;/p> &lt;p>So I think it&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to look at how traditional, on-the-street community organizing can inform purposeful online activism. Once we move beyond the &amp;ldquo;blast all your friends with a link to a petition&amp;rdquo; phase, there are concrete &lt;em>strategies&lt;/em> to which we can turn. And many of those strategies are drawn directly from a century or more of social mobilization.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="principles-of-community-organizing" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Principles of community organizing&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>There are five primary ideas in which traditional community organizing is rooted: &lt;strong>movement-building, strategy, community accountability, going where the people are, and cultivating leadership&lt;/strong>. There are more principles and strategies to be sure (and you may disagree whether these five are at the top), but I see these as having the most to say to online activism.&lt;/p> &lt;h4 id="organizing-for-a-movement" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Organizing for a movement&lt;/span>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>Community organizing is based on long-term strategy. &amp;ldquo;Empowerment&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; that is, facilitating the realization among individuals and communities that they have the power to effect change &amp;ndash; is not something you expect to occur overnight.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;em>How this relates to online activism:&lt;/em> &lt;strong>Every action should be pointing people toward a greater goal.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s straightfoward enough to get people out to a single event, or taking a single online action. But cultivating those individuals so they see their action as part of a long-term campaign is something that takes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p> &lt;h4 id="strategy-strategy-strategy" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Strategy, strategy, strategy&lt;/span>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about the fact that social media isn&amp;rsquo;t about doing &lt;em>less&lt;/em> organizing, it&amp;rsquo;s about &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/05/social-change-takes-more-social-media">doing it better&lt;/a>. A theory of social change is critical to an individual or organization engaging in online activism. Will signing this petition against the war put pressure on elected leaders to alter policies? Will this upcoming rally (or &amp;ldquo;virtual march&amp;rdquo;) demonstrate a community&amp;rsquo;s growing power &amp;ndash; or is it &amp;ldquo;busy work&amp;rdquo; for supporters who haven&amp;rsquo;t been asked to do anything in a while?&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;em>How this relates to online activism:&lt;/em> &lt;strong>Too many nonprofits, unfortunately, seem to engage in token actions that don&amp;rsquo;t move things forward as part of an overall strategy.&lt;/strong> And even when a given action is a part of a strategy, nonprofits are often vague about communicating that to supporters. Exactly &lt;em>how&lt;/em> will calling this legislator advance a critical piece of legislation? Is there a chance the bill will actually pass? If not, there could be other legitimate strategy to build public support for it &amp;ndash; things are long-term, remember? &amp;ndash; but organizations must be clear to supporters that &amp;ldquo;victory&amp;rdquo; in this case won&amp;rsquo;t be a new law, but, for instance, 10 vocal new supporters in Congress.&lt;/p> &lt;h4 id="being-accountable-to-a-real-world-community" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Being accountable to a real-world community&lt;/span>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>Community organizers are often derided as rabble-rousers, troublemakers, or professional activists who dupe people into following them. But true community organizing isn&amp;rsquo;t about swooping in and ginning up outrage by telling the locals to fight the man. It&amp;rsquo;s generally approached as much more &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/10/finding-movements-voice-online-social-networks-social-change">Freirian&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; taking direction from and being accountable to the local community. Organizers bring their experience of tactics and strategy, and may serve to inspire people that they &lt;em>do&lt;/em> have the power to make change. But the causes around which communities organize should come from the community itself.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;em>How this relates to online activism:&lt;/em> Technology is &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/04/fire-food-why-theres-no-such-thing-twitter-revolution">too often seen as a strategy in and of itself&lt;/a>. But the Internet and social media &amp;ndash; like fax machines, phone trees and the printing press before them &amp;ndash; are simply tools, able to be used tactically to great effect, but only when part of a larger strategy. Focusing on the tech divorces a campaign from its community, and leaves the online organizer in the role of the &amp;ldquo;expert&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to use Twitter to clean up your city!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; leaving little room for a community to actually control the direction of a campaign.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Remembering that the community&amp;rsquo;s long-term strategy is paramount &amp;ndash; and being willing to listen, discern and collaborate with that community &amp;ndash; will help keep the people whose lives and livelihoods are on the line actually in charge.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;h4 id="go-where-the-people-are" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Go where the people are&lt;/span>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>Social change happens in communal spaces &amp;ndash; not always public, but nearly always intimate to the community as it exists. Workers&amp;rsquo; homes and pubs in the labor movement, black churches in the US civil rights movement, gay bars in the gay rights movement, and college campuses in numerous student movements attest to this fact.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;em>How this relates to online activism:&lt;/em> &lt;strong>Rarely will it be effective to create a private &amp;ldquo;walled garden&amp;rdquo; social network that you have to convince people to join and become active on.&lt;/strong> Different communities are on different social networks online &amp;ndash; and &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2008/10/using-social-networks-social-change-facebook-myspace-more#weaving">it&amp;rsquo;s important to know where your constituencies are&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; on Facebook, MySpace, Twitter or somewhere else. The places where a community is most active socially are most likely to be the places where it&amp;rsquo;s most effective to organize. If you&amp;rsquo;re organizing in a sensitive environment, you may have to establish some level of privacy around your campaign, but only &lt;em>after&lt;/em> you&amp;rsquo;ve already engaged people where they are.&lt;/p> &lt;h4 id="cultivating-sustainable-leadership" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Cultivating sustainable leadership&lt;/span>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>This is an area to which traditional community organizing aspires, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t always succeed. The temptation for a &amp;ldquo;charismatic leader&amp;rdquo; to emerge and indefinitely control the direction of a social change campaign can be strong. Participants may initially be relieved that they don&amp;rsquo;t have to &amp;ldquo;take the heat&amp;rdquo; when things get tough, and can look to their leader for direction.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Yet time and again we&amp;rsquo;ve seen movements collapse when the leader &amp;ndash; having captured power within the movement or had it thrust upon him or her &amp;ndash; burns out or becomes unable to continue. Increasingly in the past half-century, social movements have attempted to make their approaches more sustainable by cultivating leadership, bringing people from the margins into the center and mentoring and encouraging emerging leaders.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;em>How this relates to online activism:&lt;/em> &lt;strong>Seek to put yourself out of a job.&lt;/strong> The best online campaigns are the ones that are self-sustaining. Encourage those who are taking the most action to begin to brainstorm new ideas and actions for the campaign. Reward people who are doing the most recruiting, and make them feel that they&amp;rsquo;re a part of the &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; of the organizing.&lt;/p> &lt;p>For nonprofits &amp;ndash; and I know this will be hard to hear &amp;ndash; stop pretending that you&amp;rsquo;re the only organization active on the issue. Support your members who become active in allied groups and consider working in coalitions early and often. Not only will this cement your supporters&amp;rsquo; dedication to the cause, it will build the identity of a long-term movement, rather than a limited &amp;ldquo;card-carrying member&amp;rdquo; view of participation.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="help-continue-this-conversation" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Help continue this conversation&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Below, I&amp;rsquo;ve embedded the slides of our presentation, which goes beyond the things I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed above and includes an exciting interactive workshop component &amp;ndash; so if you&amp;rsquo;re at NTC, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120202003828/https://www.ntenonline.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?webcode=SessionDetails&amp;amp;ses_key=9e27f6a5-1720-4ad1-8ee0-058a2260bcbb" title="View time, location and other information on this session">please do stop by&lt;/a>!&lt;/p> &lt;p>And as I wrote awhile back &lt;a href="https://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2009/06/listening-leads-to-engagement-relationship-models.html">in a similar discussion on Beth Kanter&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a>:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>The old model of nonprofit/social change theory is that the organization has the power. You sign up with an organization &lt;em>in order to&lt;/em> have an impact; the organization mobilizes its supporters successfully based on their numbers but fundamentally the strategy is coming from the top.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The new model of social change embodied in the social web is the wisdom of the network. The power isn&amp;rsquo;t inherent in the organization though they may act as the catalyst. In this case people become part of the organization &lt;em>as part of the process&lt;/em> of having an impact. Indeed, many of the most effective supporters may be &amp;ldquo;outside&amp;rdquo; the organization on paper. The value comes from the network rather than the membership.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>So in some ways, the dynamics of social media is actually driving us toward more sustainable, honest organizing, in which advocacy groups can provide expertise, training, resources and education, but it&amp;rsquo;s the grassroots that is mobilizing to effect change. Looked at this way, a lot of day-to-day online organizers have already taken up the best parts of offline community organizing &amp;ndash; and it&amp;rsquo;s on the &amp;ldquo;professional activists&amp;rdquo; to catch up.&lt;/p> &lt;hr> &lt;p>&lt;strong>I welcome any thoughts, comments or ideas. How do you see community organizing informing &amp;ndash; or being separate from &amp;ndash; online activism? What examples have you seen of successes or failures?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Ivan Boothe&lt;/strong> is a social change scholar with a degree in peace and conflict studies. With hundreds of hours of training in community organizing and years of experience in real-world social change, he&amp;rsquo;s excited about the ways in which social media can, when used strategically, amplify the ability of activists to change the world.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Government accountability through web 2.0: A case study</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/11/government-accountability-through-web-20-case-study/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/11/government-accountability-through-web-20-case-study/</guid><description>&lt;p> &lt;figure> &lt;picture> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2009/11/government-accountability-through-web-20-case-study/scott-gration-samantha-power_flickr-savedarfur.avif" type="image/avif"> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2009/11/government-accountability-through-web-20-case-study/scott-gration-samantha-power_flickr-savedarfur.webp" type="image/webp"> &lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Special Envoy to Sudan Gen.

Here was a chance for anti-genocide activists to put the White House&amp;rsquo;s point person on Sudan on the spot and demand answers.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>The responses from Gration &amp;ndash; Power, other than introducing and concluding the event, largely remained silent &amp;ndash; were generally panned by activists watching the chat via Twitter and Facebook.&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;In his opening remarks Gration said &amp;lsquo;we owe you answers&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; you still do,&amp;rdquo; said &lt;a data-dead-link="http://twitter.com/willcfischer/statuses/5599271449" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/dead-link/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fwillcfischer%2Fstatuses%2F5599271449" title="http://twitter.com/willcfischer/statuses/5599271449 [dead link]" >Will Fischer&lt;/a >. &amp;ldquo;I respect the hell out of Sam Power but I&amp;rsquo;m not going to buy Gration&amp;rsquo;s vague answers just because she&amp;rsquo;s sitting there,&amp;rdquo; said Genocide Intervention Network Director of Membership &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgoldbeck/status/5599046520">Janessa Goldbeck&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Bec Hamilton, who is writing a book about the advocacy movement around Sudan and has worked with the Genocide Intervention Network, reported that the questions for Gration had to be &lt;a href="http://bechamilton.com/2009/11/09/ask-us-responding-to-activists-or-managing-them/" title="Bec Hamilton: Responding to activists or managing them?">submitted ahead of time&lt;/a>, so it&amp;rsquo;s a little surprising his answers weren&amp;rsquo;t more sure-footed. Hamilton &lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/11/11/gration-and-power-answer-activists-questions-on-sudan/" title="ForeignPolicy.com: Gration and Power answer activists' questions on Sudan">said&lt;/a> a former official at the State Department had seen the event as a way to &amp;ldquo;manage&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;noise&amp;rdquo; of activists, but:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>As it turned out, the shoe was on the other foot. Activists were given the opportunity to ask follow-up questions, and they pursued that avenue with such vigor that any fear of them being co-opted by their well-publicized access to the White House ceased to be a concern. What was a concern was the administration&amp;rsquo;s inability to provide concrete answers to the advocates&amp;rsquo; questions.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>&lt;strong>If the White House was hoping the webcast would placate activists who had been critical of US policy on Sudan, it seemed to do just the opposite.&lt;/strong> Goldbeck, responding to Gration&amp;rsquo;s statement that &amp;ldquo;we know we are going to be held accountable by you,&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgoldbeck/status/5599234951">tweeted&lt;/a> &amp;ldquo;Yes you will,&amp;rdquo; a message widely reposted by others.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Emily Diamond-Falk, a spokesperson for the Save Darfur Coalition, was more amiable about the exchange with the White House. &amp;ldquo;As much transparency as they can give us, they will do, without compromising their policy,&amp;rdquo; she told me. &amp;ldquo;He wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to disclose as much information as we asked, which is going to happen in these sorts of things. &amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s a very delicate line, so engaging policy behind the scenes will still be necessary.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="making-the-online-qa-possible" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Making the online Q&amp;amp;A possible&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Andrea Clarke, director of communications for the Save Darfur Coalition, pitched the idea of a &amp;ldquo;live online town hall&amp;rdquo; to Gration&amp;rsquo;s communications director in August. &amp;ldquo;We thought it would be something beneficial for activists to be directly engaged around the [Sudan] policy,&amp;rdquo; Clarke said.&lt;/p> &lt;p>After suggesting the idea of an online town hall to Gration, the special envoy suggested the student organization STAND be a part of the conversation as well. &amp;ldquo;The special envoy&amp;rsquo;s office was very committed to answering as many questions as possible, and the involvement of STAND was key to that process,&amp;rdquo; Clarke said. &amp;ldquo;It made for a greater diversity of questions, and we feel the activist community was very well represented.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>Gration&amp;rsquo;s travel itinerary made scheduling difficult, and in the end it occurred without much advance notice. Clarke said Save Darfur received at least 500 questions from activists for the special envoy, and &amp;ldquo;I think if we have more lead time we&amp;rsquo;ll have even more questions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>As Micah Sifry &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201200824/http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/ask-us-state-department-20-sudan-darfur-and-public-engagement" title="TechPresident: Ask U.S., State Department 2.0 on Sudan, Darfur and Public Engagement">wrote on Monday&lt;/a>, the willingness of the State Department and White House to engage openly and publicly with advocates who are often critical seems unprecedented. Given the negative response to Gration&amp;rsquo;s responses, might this kind of transparency be short-lived?&lt;/p> &lt;p>Clarke said she had &amp;ldquo;no reason to believe there won&amp;rsquo;t be&amp;rdquo; similar events in the future as part of the &amp;ldquo;Ask U.S.&amp;rdquo; program. Gration &amp;ldquo;appears to be working very hard to get feedback,&amp;rdquo; she said. Gration himself &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121114080249/http://www.state.gov/s/sudan/listserve/131887.htm" title="US State Department: Innovative Engagement with Advocacy Groups on Sudan">wrote&lt;/a> that the State Department is &amp;ldquo;eager to continue an active and robust dialogue with the advocacy community.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>Layla Amjadi of STAND lamented the lack of specificity in Gration&amp;rsquo;s answers, &lt;a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-2009-11-11-voa5-69822412/415509.html" title="Voice of America: Student Activists Encourage White House to Raise Anti-Genocide Concerns about Darfur">telling&lt;/a> the Voice of America that activists &amp;ldquo;were really frustrated by how vague the policy review was on benchmarks and pressures and incentives.&amp;rdquo; She called for an approach involving bigger players than Gration alone &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Obama, Biden and Clinton&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121114043535/http://www.standnow.org/blog/response-tuesdays-ask-us-meeting">declared&lt;/a>:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>Now that we &lt;em>know&lt;/em> that we&amp;rsquo;ve got their ear, let&amp;rsquo;s talk to them. They&amp;rsquo;re looking for us to hold them accountable. So let&amp;rsquo;s do it.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There are certainly questions that activists who are voices for those who cannot necessarily be heard right now have, and it&amp;rsquo;s important that those questions are answered by the administration,&amp;rdquo; said Diamond-Falk. &amp;ldquo;The fact that [Gration] engaged the Save Darfur Coalition and the student movement &amp;hellip; proves that activists have to have a voice on this issue and in this administration.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="the-future-of-high-level-advocacy" class="link_owner">&lt;span>The future of high-level advocacy?&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We certainly hope that this can be one tactic that other advocacy groups can use to demand accountability of the administration,&amp;rdquo; Clarke said. &amp;ldquo;I hope this is something that&amp;rsquo;s taken on board by communications departments of other advocacy groups.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Most organizations may not have the political pressure necessary to convince public officials to host a live, online questioning.&lt;/strong> The broad constituency that has been active around Darfur and Southern Sudan for the past five years was a definite advantage to making the webcast happen, Clarke said, as was President Obama&amp;rsquo;s stated support on the campaign trail for resolving the crises in Sudan.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Gration&amp;rsquo;s willingness to engage activists on the issue, however, may have been the most critical element&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine a live Q&amp;amp;A happening without a public official&amp;rsquo;s support. &amp;ldquo;Gration appears to be working very hard to get feedback,&amp;rdquo; Clarke said.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Engaging more than one organization made the proposal more attractive to public officials.&lt;/strong> Save Darfur asked for the event, and the special envoy&amp;rsquo;s office suggested a representative of student activists join as well. Gration&amp;rsquo;s office wanted the event to be seen as legitimately representing the entire Sudan advocacy movement, not simply a single pressure group.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Cautious criticism seemed to have paid off in helping make the dialogue possible.&lt;/strong> Many Sudan advocacy organizations including STAND and Save Darfur have been publicly supportive of the special envoy, while continuing to push for more transparency and specifics. Gration had been criticized by some activists as &amp;ldquo;naive&amp;rdquo; with some going so far as &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/70919/the-ingratiator" title="The New Republic: The Ingratiator">demanding his resignation&lt;/a>, but responses from Save Darfur and STAND&amp;rsquo;s parent organization, the Genocide Intervention Network, had largely &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112172651/http://www.genocideintervention.net/blog/2009/11/05/should_gration_be_fired_gi_net_responds" title="Genocide Intervention Network: Should Gration be fired? GI-Net responds.">not suggested&lt;/a> that level of displeasure. &amp;ldquo;I think that we don&amp;rsquo;t always agree with the special envoy&amp;rsquo;s office, but we maintain an open line of communication, and that has helped us a lot,&amp;rdquo; Clarke said.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>As for the issue of Sudan, could pressure on legislators coupled with Gration&amp;rsquo;s limited responses provoke more Congressional action?&lt;/strong> The online event with Gration directly followed a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091023040807/http://www.pledge2protect.net/" title="Pledge2Protect Conference">conference&lt;/a> for anti-genocide activists, including a full day of meetings with members of Congress. Diamond-Falk pointed out that following the student lobbying and live webchat, 44 members of Congress signed a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121114034243/http://allafrica.com/stories/200911130892.html" title="AllAfrica: Letter from U.S. Members of Congress to the President on China's Involvement in Sudan">letter to President Obama&lt;/a> ahead of his visit to China, a major trading partner of Sudan&amp;rsquo;s, urging the president to make Sudan a priority in his discussions there.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Clarke said if a second online Q&amp;amp;A occurs, Save Darfur &amp;ldquo;will be pushing for questions that are extremely direct from those who are suffering on the ground,&amp;rdquo; suggesting the event can not only be a chance to connect activists to the administration, but survivors of the genocide and wars in Sudan as well.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> Bec Hamilton &lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/11/11/gration-and-power-answer-activists-questions-on-sudan/" title="ForeignPolicy.com: Gration and Power answer activists' questions on Sudan">reported&lt;/a> that a &lt;em>former&lt;/em> State Department official had called Sudan activists &amp;ldquo;noise we had to manage,&amp;rdquo; and I mistakenly attributed it to &lt;em>current&lt;/em> State Department officials; it&amp;rsquo;s been corrected in the text above.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Causes abandons 184,674 nonprofit supporters on MySpace</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/11/causes-abandons-184674-nonprofit-supporters-myspace/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/11/causes-abandons-184674-nonprofit-supporters-myspace/</guid><description>&lt;p>This morning, the fundraising application &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201194319/http://www.causes.com/">Causes&lt;/a> quietly shut down their presence on MySpace. In their email to administrators of Causes on MySpace, they wrote:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>Thank you for the work you&amp;rsquo;ve done on Causes on MySpace. Due to the lack of activity on MySpace, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to focus our efforts on the Causes application on Facebook. On Friday at noon EDT, we will be removing all causes from MySpace. In the meantime, you can post a link to a cause on Facebook (or create one at &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203065755/http://apps.facebook.com/causes/">http://apps.facebook.com/causes&lt;/a>) asking your members to change over. We appreciate the work you&amp;rsquo;ve put into your cause community on MySpace and we hope that the broader functionality available on the Causes application on Facebook will offer you even more opportunities to raise awareness, advocate for change and fundraise for your nonprofit. If you have questions, please email &lt;a href="mailto:support@causes.com">support@causes.com&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>&lt;strong>At that exact moment, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091024070619/https://myspace.com/causesapp">Causes on MySpace&lt;/a> had 184,674 current users.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s 184,674 individual people (minus a few nonprofit staffers) who had taken the time to install an application on MySpace specifically so they could show their support for a nonprofit charity or advocacy group on the social network.&lt;/p> &lt;p>As of today, those nonprofit badges have been removed from each of those 184,674 profiles, with no notice to those supporters as to why their Causes badges have disappeared. (The application&amp;rsquo;s page on MySpace is still up, with no notification that it&amp;rsquo;s being shut down; new users who try to add it get a message saying it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;temporarily unavailable.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p> &lt;p>No notice has been posted to the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091108190641/http://exchange.causes.com/">Causes blog&lt;/a>; Susan Gordon, the Senior Nonprofit Coordinator of Causes, said in an email to me, &amp;ldquo;We didn&amp;rsquo;t put the announcement on the blog before because the number of people using the MySpace app is so small.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="why-causes-on-myspace-failed-lack-of-engagement" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Why Causes on MySpace failed: Lack of engagement&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not clear from either email when Causes decided to shut down the MySpace side of its operation, or why it chose to do so within just a few days. Causes began on Facebook and has always had more users on there (currently 35.2 &lt;em>million&lt;/em>). From Causes&amp;rsquo; point of view, MySpace was probably more trouble than it was worth given the percentage of their total users, though I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call nearly 200,000 people a &amp;ldquo;small&amp;rdquo; number.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Causes on Facebook had, from the beginning, more to offer nonprofits than its MySpace version.&lt;/strong> Nonprofits could, for instance, send email messages to all their Causes supporters on Facebook &amp;ndash; something not possible using Fan Pages or Facebook Groups over 2,000 people. On MySpace, probably due to the limitations of the network itself, there was no such functionality.&lt;/p> &lt;p>In fact, in one of my first write-ups on &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2008/10/using-social-networks-social-change-facebook-myspace-more#keys">using social networks for fundraising and advocacy&lt;/a>, &lt;strong>I highlighted Causes not as a great way to fundraise but as a great way to engage members&lt;/strong>. There was less chance for engagement on MySpace; though supporters could still put up a badge demonstrating their support and make donations, in my experience those were actually the least useful parts of Causes. &lt;a href="https://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2009/04/hello-washington-post-dolllars-per-facebook-donor-is-not-the-right-metric-for-success.html">As I wrote earlier this year&lt;/a>:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>Someone who expects Causes &amp;ndash; or any social networking approach &amp;ndash; to replace their development director doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand the nature of social networks. It&amp;rsquo;s not about building a more effective ATM &amp;ndash; sorry, &amp;ldquo;donor list&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s about cultivating relationships with your most passionate supporters, giving them ways to speak in their own voice and connecting them with other people.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Most young folks who are on social networks get this, since it&amp;rsquo;s how they&amp;rsquo;re relating socially on these networks already. (As danah boyd has said, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not addicted to computers, we&amp;rsquo;re addicted to friends.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>Again, I suspect this was a limitation imposed by MySpace, so I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily fault Causes. The lesson here, though, is that &lt;strong>a fundraising widget is not enough of a draw&lt;/strong>. The chance for engaging supporters &amp;ndash; not just in things like one-way email blasts but in things like leaderboards showing the top fundraisers among supporter-created Causes &amp;ndash; is, in the end, the &amp;ldquo;killer&amp;rdquo; part of this app.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="what-this-means-for-nonprofits-on-myspace" class="link_owner">&lt;span>What this means for nonprofits on MySpace&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Despite repeated claims that MySpace is &amp;ldquo;dead,&amp;rdquo; I continue to think it&amp;rsquo;s a smart move for many nonprofits to have a presence there.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Sociologist danah boyd has documented the clear &lt;a href="https://www.danah.org/papers/talks/PDF2009.html" title="The Not-So-Hidden Politics of Class Online">socioeconomic&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.danah.org/papers/talks/ICA2009.html" title="MySpace vs. Facebook: A Digital Enactment of Class-Based Social Categories Amongst American Teenagers">differences&lt;/a> between MySpace and Facebook, and Amy Sample Ward has stressed the need to &lt;a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/first_and_foremost_know_your_community" title="First and Foremost: Know your Community">know your community and where it is&lt;/a>. Facebook, after all, was built by and for middle- and owning-class college-educated folks &amp;ndash; exactly those people who fill nonprofit staffs. But if your organization &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003162738/http://www.marketingfornonprofits.org/2009/11/are-online-communities-just-as.html?showComment=1257526462528#c6820898715423075412">serves a different community&lt;/a>, then simply going where your staff is familiar might not be the best choice.&lt;/p> &lt;p>For those who want to do peer-to-peer fundraising on MySpace, there are still widgets like &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120129184134/http://www.chipin.com/">ChipIn&lt;/a> available for that purpose. They won&amp;rsquo;t have the &amp;ldquo;built-in&amp;rdquo; feel that Causes on MySpace did, but they&amp;rsquo;re fairly easy to guide people through with a quick training or video.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="what-this-means-for-nonprofit-fundraising-on-social-networks" class="link_owner">&lt;span>What this means for nonprofit fundraising on social networks&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>The bigger lesson here is that you can&amp;rsquo;t rely on third-party, often for-profit services to support your organization&amp;rsquo;s interests.&lt;/strong> To Causes, leaving MySpace to focus on its core community on Facebook made good business sense, but certainly those organizations left in the lurch on MySpace feel otherwise.&lt;/p> &lt;p>I think Rebecca Leaman &lt;a data-dead-link="http://twitter.com/rjleaman/status/5430851340" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/dead-link/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Frjleaman%2Fstatus%2F5430851340" title="http://twitter.com/rjleaman/status/5430851340 [dead link]" >said it best&lt;/a > &amp;ndash; don&amp;rsquo;t put &amp;ldquo;all fundraising eggs in one third-party basket!&amp;rdquo; These services are useful, and can help your organization advance its mission, but it&amp;rsquo;s not accountable to you &amp;ndash; and you need to have other options.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="letting-go-of-your-message-holding-on-to-your-relationships" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Letting go of your message, holding on to your relationships&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I (and many others) have often said that in order to be successful in social media, nonprofits need to be willing to give up some control over their message &amp;ndash; to let supporters speak in their own voice. What Causes&amp;rsquo; move has exposed, though, is that while it&amp;rsquo;s important to let go of your message, you still need to have control over your relationships.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Nonprofits don&amp;rsquo;t own or even control the connections they have with their supporters in these spaces&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; the comments, messages, badges and memberships of supporters within social networks are all locked within those social networks and are used under contract (terms of service) from the social network.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Systems like &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091115121119/https://developers.facebook.com/connect.php">Facebook Connect&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201191441/http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/">OpenSocial&lt;/a> allow those relationships to be exposed elsewhere, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the same as control. If the social network or service decides the nonprofit has run afoul of the contract, or the company goes bankrupt, cancels services or features, or gets sold to a different company who does &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s nothing an organization will be able to do.&lt;/p> &lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s important to have multiple channels of communication with supporters and to continually try to &lt;a href="http://orgnet.com/sna.html">move people toward the center&lt;/a> of your organization by deepening involvement, so that if you lose them in one space they don&amp;rsquo;t simply fade off into the ether.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="open-source-open-data-open-networks" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Open-source, open data, open networks&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Amy Sample Ward makes some great points that social change communities may have to &lt;a href="https://amysampleward.org/2009/11/06/new-on-ssir-letting-technology-lead/">take the lead on technology&lt;/a> by pushing for more openness and transparency. I&amp;rsquo;ve written before, for instance, that &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/01/community-blogs-run-better-open-source-software">community blogs run better on open-source software&lt;/a>, and I think in principle the same is true for social networks.&lt;/p> &lt;p>But nonprofits and social change movements will always have to go where the supporters are &amp;ndash; and in many cases that will mean closed, proprietary, walled-garden social networks.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>What would it look like if nonprofits and social change movements &amp;ndash; which these third party applications often use to market themselves as effective and &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; started demanding some openness?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Is it reasonable to assert that organizations and individuals should &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo; their relationships, even when within a proprietary network? Can long-term social change happen when connections must be re-built on each new online social network to be developed?&lt;/p> &lt;p>While Causes on MySpace may be no more, I think this event raises some important questions for the relationship between nonprofits, social change, and for-profit software and services. What are your thoughts?&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen &lt;a href="https://readwrite.com/causes_on_myspace/">Read Write Web&amp;rsquo;s coverage&lt;/a> of this, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth a read. As I say above, I think Causes&amp;rsquo; supposed &amp;ldquo;failures&amp;rdquo; to raise tons of money for nonprofits is less of an issue than some might think (for a great perspective on this, see &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120305054803/http://afine2.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/wash-post-disses-causes-on-facebook/">Allison Fine&lt;/a>). But as many of the commenters suggest, the way forward is to explore mechanisms for open-sourcing our relationships from these closed, proprietary systems, be they widgets like Causes or networks like Facebook and MySpace.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Finding the movement's voice: Online social networks and social change</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/10/finding-movements-voice-online-social-networks-social-change/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/10/finding-movements-voice-online-social-networks-social-change/</guid><description>&lt;p> &lt;figure> &lt;picture> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2009/10/finding-movements-voice-online-social-networks-social-change/pjsa-twfbhead.avif" type="image/avif"> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2009/10/finding-movements-voice-online-social-networks-social-change/pjsa-twfbhead.webp" type="image/webp"> &lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Images of the workshop flyers" class="image_figure image_internal image_processed" width="720" height="373" src="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2009/10/finding-movements-voice-online-social-networks-social-change/pjsa-twfbhead.jpg" /> &lt;/picture> &lt;/figure> &lt;/p> &lt;p>Today at the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091013231101/http://www.peacejusticestudies.org/conference" title="Read more about the conference">Peace and Justice Studies Association 2009 Conference&lt;/a> at Marquette University, I hosted a workshop called, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091013231106/http://www.peacejusticestudies.org/conference/sessions.php?con=C.4">Finding the Movement&amp;rsquo;s Voice: Online Social Networks and Social Change&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p> &lt;p>The subtitle of this workshop could be, &amp;ldquo;Social change has always relied on social networks &amp;ndash; they just weren&amp;rsquo;t called Facebook.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking concretely about the &lt;em>strategy&lt;/em> of using online tools for social change.

But folks involved in social change &amp;ndash; online or offline &amp;ndash; can&amp;rsquo;t stay there. We have to be willing to step up and do the difficult organizing work that leverages our knowledge and experts&amp;rsquo; data into something larger: a movement.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="everybody-organizing-everybody" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Everybody Organizing Everybody&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Community organizers are a natural fit for &amp;ldquo;web 2.0&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the movement from one-way broadcasting on the web to two-way coversation and connection. I want to expand the definition a little bit, however, and suggest that online organizing goes far beyond the professional, experienced organizers.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>One of the defining aspects of web 2.0 is social &lt;em>organization&lt;/em>.&lt;/strong> People are constantly presented with their social circles in visual media: Facebook news feeds, MySpace top friends, Twitter updates, etc. In short, more people can see their network, in a much more literal way. This is especially true for young adults (currently Millennials) who might have social networks scattered across wide geographic areas and are less firmly rooted to a specific place through vocational, familial or other commitments.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Communities at the margins of society have always had a more visceral understanding of their social networks, which are often the sites of social change planning and strategizing &amp;ndash; consider the role of black churches in the US civil rights movement, or gay bars and bathhouses in the early Stonewall era of the gay rights movement. So I don&amp;rsquo;t want to suggest that this phenomenon of a community visualized is necessarily new for everyone, but I think it is new for many folks in the mainstream of society.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>The online &amp;ldquo;social web&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; social networks and social media &amp;ndash; allows people to organize their social connections&lt;/strong>, not simply to put them in order, but to connect and collaborate with others. Evite invitations and Facebook events are clear examples of this, as is Wikipedia.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Increasingly, the social web is teaching everyday folks how to be community organizers.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s usually gurus, however, who get &amp;ndash; or take &amp;ndash; the credit for this transformation. On the contrary, I see it as a much more grassroots bubbling-up of organizing skills. Everyone has the ability to organize and inspire others; the current tools are simply making those skills more visible.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="fewer-leaders-more-leadership" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Fewer Leaders, More Leadership&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Organizations and societies,&amp;rdquo; wrote Bruce Kokopeli and George Lakey, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>do need leadership&lt;/em>, but they &lt;em>do not need leaders&lt;/em>.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> They argued for a shared value of leadership, in which many individuals took responsibility for the direction of a group, but didn&amp;rsquo;t invest the institutional power in a single person to call the shots. A critical part of this feminist approach relies on cultivating leadership among more and more individuals. Everyone has a stake, and everyone has a say.&lt;/p> &lt;p>While there are particular challenges putting that theory into practice in an organization, the good news is that movements, particularly those engaging in online social change, are particularly positioned to take advantage of this approach.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>The fact that more people are organizers, and that everyone can exercise leadership, does not mean that there is no role for the full-time organizer.&lt;/strong> Indeed, the &amp;ldquo;professional&amp;rdquo; organizer becomes more important than ever, passing on stories and lived experience, and sharing a pedagogy for cultivating new leadership. What fades away is the positioning of some people within a movement as &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo; to whom everyone looks for direction.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Paulo Freire calls such an approach &amp;ldquo;co-intentional education,&amp;rdquo; in which each person is both teacher and student. Those with more experience may seek to inspire or ask questions to further dialogue, but as a way to further develop strategy rather than dictate to or control the masses.&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>Attempting to liberate the oppressed without their reflective participation in the act of liberation is to treat them as objects which must be saved from a burning building; it is to lead them into the populist pitfall and transform them into masses which can be manipulated. &amp;hellip; [T]he oppressed must see themselves as women and men engaged in the &amp;hellip; vocation of becoming more fully human.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>This may seem like heavy or strident language in the context of online petition drives or peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns. But my goal is to push social change organizers to look toward the larger picture. What sort of movement do you want to build in the long-term? What role do people play in that movement &amp;ndash; is it a passive one of letter-signing and donation-giving, or an active one of working from the ground up for lasting change?&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="selling-giving-and-cultivating" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Selling, Giving and Cultivating&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Want to support online organizing?

They know how to sell the idea of &amp;ldquo;social good&amp;rdquo; to the public at large, using people&amp;rsquo;s goodwill toward a cause as a way to market to them through a given company, and increase donations to a partner charity. Well-known examples of this are the &lt;a href="https://www.red.org/">RED campaign&lt;/a> and Starbucks' &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090207001439/http://www.ethoswater.com/">Ethos Water&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Online organizers turn a skeptical eye toward &amp;ldquo;social good&amp;rdquo; and social marketing.&lt;/strong> It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean such projects aren&amp;rsquo;t worth exploring or learning from, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that everyone involved is a charlatan simply out to make a buck. But selling people an identity, even a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; one, is fundamentally different from organizing for social change. Freire again: &amp;ldquo;Conviction cannot be packaged and sold; it is reached, rather, by means of a totality of reflection and action.&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Movement building also goes beyond electoral organizing.&lt;/strong> Folks working for social change often form common cause with those organizing around a political candidate, and there is of course much to be learned and shared between the two practices. But whereas elections are centered around a single charismatic leader, a fully-engaged, vibrant social change movement consists of both shared vision and shared leadership. Elections give people an answer, while movements ask people a question &amp;ndash; and then encourage them to speak for themselves.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Instead of selling or giving supporters a solution, then, online organizers are involved in cultivation.&lt;/strong> There are pieces of both social marketing and electoral organizing present in online organizing, of course, and experts in these fields can be a useful source of data, but we should be wary of replicating these other models when it comes to leadership.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="network-wisdom" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Network Wisdom&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>There is a developing praxis being explored by numerous thinkers and strategists in online organizing.

As if the phrase has lost its meaning somehow. Or a bubble had been burst. I know I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling the same way. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling it too &amp;ndash; or come across others with a similar vibe?&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>Joe runs through some great responses from a whole bevy of social-media-for-change folks, including me.&lt;/p> &lt;p>One of the comments on Joe&amp;rsquo;s blog post was from &lt;a href="https://texansagainsthunger.blogspot.com/">Texans Against Hunger&lt;/a>. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the author said:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>Funny, I clicked on this post from Twitter expecting a realistic conversation about the limitations of social media tools. Instead, it appears everyone took your question about being jaded to mean &amp;ldquo;How can I get un-jaded,&amp;rdquo; and not, &amp;ldquo;Should I be jaded?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>The assumption of most twitters above seems to be that these tools work because they&amp;rsquo;re cool OR they&amp;rsquo;ve built a career around them, so if you&amp;rsquo;re feeling jaded due to lack of results or encouraging metrics, get over it and get back to your (disappointing) work.&lt;/p> &lt;p>IMO, social media tools are pretty poor at changing anything that takes more than one or two mouse-clicks. Sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s all you need &amp;ndash; making a donation, sending petitions, affecting website ratings, flooding online polls, etc.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Most change, unfortunately, doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen at the end of a mouse-click. But in the long run, these tools also do a good job of hoovering up potential participants for offline actions that will make a difference.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Perhaps our jadedness comes from a disconnect between the revolutionary nature of the tool, and its less-than-mindblowing uses? If that&amp;rsquo;s the case we&amp;rsquo;ll be managing our own expectations, given enough time.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>I thought the author made some good points that &amp;ldquo;social change techies&amp;rdquo; would do well to keep in mind. I can see how the author might have gotten the impression that some or all of the folks in Joe&amp;rsquo;s roundup are simply shiny-tech pushers. I won&amp;rsquo;t try to speak for them, but I do think they aren&amp;rsquo;t blindly following the latest tech hype and hoping it will change the world &amp;ndash; many of them have clear social change strategies.&lt;/p> &lt;p>My own background is rooted in a) on-the-ground community organizing, including 100+ hours of training and many times that in actual organizing, and b) academic study of how nonviolent social change can be successful (my degree is in peace and conflict studies). I know &amp;ldquo;social change&amp;rdquo; can be kind of a squishy term (and even more so the strategy-free &amp;ldquo;social good,&amp;rdquo; which Katrin Verclas has &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130122173735/http://katrinskaya.tumblr.com/post/89065553/charity-versus-change-and-why-aid-is-bad-part-1">amply discussed&lt;/a>), so I want to position myself as specifically interested in fundamental social change, at the political, social, economic and cultural levels. I don&amp;rsquo;t see the challenges as being easily fixed, or short-term, or things that can be addressed with a few pieces of legislation or a few institutional reforms.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>With that in mind, I think social media and social networking hasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely matured as part of long-term social change.&lt;/strong> Where it has been getting integrated into social justice organizing, it&amp;rsquo;s largely been outside the United States, in places like &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110907201210/http://info.howcast.com/press/releases/facebook-google-youtube-mtv-howcast-columbia">Colombia&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://ethanzuckerman.com/2006/09/16/alaa-on-egyptian-blogs-and-activism/">Egypt&lt;/a>. And even there, while we can see important strategic concessions, not enough time has really passed to see the extent to which social media helped advance social justice campaigns.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>I entirely share the author&amp;rsquo;s frustration with &amp;ldquo;tech for social change&amp;rdquo; discussions that fawn over the technology and don&amp;rsquo;t engage on the level of strategic change.&lt;/strong> I saw this happening in particular during the &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/04/fire-food-why-theres-no-such-thing-twitter-revolution">Moldovan &amp;ldquo;Twitter revolution&amp;rdquo; discussion&lt;/a> (which Joe linked to in his post). This &amp;ldquo;revolution&amp;rdquo; seemed to captivate a lot of armchair activists on Twitter, mostly because it involved Twitter. They seemed to miss the fact that a) Twitter wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually a big part of the organizing strategy, and b) the campaign itself didn&amp;rsquo;t end up seriously threatening the regime; at best it was a mild skirmish and it certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t a &amp;ldquo;revolution&amp;rdquo; of any kind. (&lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/04/fire-food-why-theres-no-such-thing-twitter-revolution#comment-46">Which is not to diminish the hard work of social justice organizers in Moldova.&lt;/a> Mad props to them.)&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>The author&amp;rsquo;s point about social media providing an outlet for people&amp;rsquo;s activism that sucks away people&amp;rsquo;s time for real social change is an excellent one.&lt;/strong> (A similar dynamic happens every two to four years in the US, when community organizers see their ranks cannibalized by electoral organizing.) Charles Lenchner has written brilliantly about this, using the principle &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011455/http://nten.org/blog/2008/04/22/mission-over-membership-in-online-advocacy">mission over membership&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>Too many nonprofits orchestrate &amp;ldquo;petition drives&amp;rdquo; that aren&amp;rsquo;t about advocating for anything other than larger membership rolls. Too many groups ask constituents to make calls to an elected official without even feigning an attempt at explaining how those calls will help achieve a goal or contribute to a longer-term campaign. &lt;strong>The author is absolutely right that too many nonprofits have no social change theory at all; indeed they&amp;rsquo;re more interested in self-perpetuation than winning&lt;/strong> (often referred to as the &lt;a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-revolution-will-not-be-funded">nonprofit industrial complex&lt;/a>). And when those groups get their hands on social media, they do incredibly un-strategic things with them.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>The fact that social media can be used unstrategically, however, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it has to be.&lt;/strong> To pull a line from my &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/04/fire-food-why-theres-no-such-thing-twitter-revolution">earlier post on Twitter&lt;/a>, political pamphlets, phone trees and jam-the-faxes must have seemed like strategies in and of themselves when each technology first came out. But smart social justice organizers recognized them as tactics, and such tactics were only effective when deployed as part of an overall strategy for social change.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Social media doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you do &lt;em>less&lt;/em> organizing &amp;ndash; it means you (can) do it &lt;em>better&lt;/em>, or at least differently.&lt;/strong> You still have to use all the old skills of coalition-building, strategic planning, creative social action, managing relationships and preventing burnout. None of that goes away just because you&amp;rsquo;re engaging with people on Facebook instead of in town halls.&lt;/p> &lt;p>So to get &amp;lsquo;round to the original question &amp;ndash; the reason I don&amp;rsquo;t feel jaded when I look at all the unstrategic uses of social media is because I&amp;rsquo;m focused on the end goal, the social change. Social justice organizers are a pretty creative bunch. Throughout history, they&amp;rsquo;ve taken a wide variety of technologies and used them strategically to move their campaigns forward. I have no doubt social media has and will become one tool in many organizers&amp;rsquo; toolbelts.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;em>Update, July 5, 2009: This post has now been &lt;a href="https://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2009/07/guest-post-by-ivan-boothe-social-change-takes-more-than-social-media.html">cross posted to Beth Kanter&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a>.

Students were &lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/04/07/moldovas-twitter-revolution/" title="'Moldova's Twitter Revolution' on Foreign Policy's net.effect">organizing&lt;/a>:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>Ever since yesterday&amp;rsquo;s announcement that Moldova&amp;rsquo;s communists have won enough votes to form a government in Sunday&amp;rsquo;s elections, Moldova&amp;rsquo;s progressive youth took to the streets in angry protests. As behooves any political protest by young people today, they also turned to Facebook and Twitter to raise awareness about the planned protests and flashmobs.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>Writers like Evgeny Morozov, above, initially characterized this as a &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/04/inside-moldovas/" title="'Inside Moldova's Twitter Revolution' on the Wired blog">Twitter revolution&lt;/a>,&amp;rdquo; modeled in the real-time use of Twitter seen during the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090604075703/http://www.digiactive.org/2009/04/02/tactic-twitter-the-new-journalism-part-2/" title="'Tactic: Using Twitter to Coordinate Protests in London' on DigiActive">G20 protests&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://votereportindia.pbworks.com/w/page/7646282/FAQ" title="Vote Report India">election monitoring&lt;/a> and crowd-sourcing the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sftorch/status/785987727" title="Twitter: SFTorch">location of a certain torch&lt;/a> when it was passing through San Francisco. (Thus a little different than the traditional &lt;a href="https://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2009/03/7-more-charities-and-charitable-giving-foundations-that-tweet-and-where-to-find-more.html" title="'Nonprofits That Tweet: Roundup of lists, resources, and examples' by Beth Kanter">nonprofit use of Twitter&lt;/a>.)&lt;/p> &lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s certainly exciting to see technology being used in ways that amplify and extend the impact of movement organizing. I think it&amp;rsquo;s easy, however, to misread the technology as the &lt;em>cause&lt;/em> of the movement rather than as simply a tool of it.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Fire, for instance, was a society-changing tool. Its revolutionary potential, however &amp;ndash; cooking food and thus making it more digestible, nutritious, and lasting &amp;ndash; was only realized through its strategic use.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Some people, awed by the fire, seem to confuse it with the food. This is represented most clearly by Jon Pincus, who &lt;a href="https://www.talesfromthe.net/jon/?p=561" title="'Twitter *is* a strategy (DRAFT)' by Jon Pincus">writes&lt;/a>:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>Twitter is a strategy.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>He cites a number of campaigns that have used Twitter in successful ways as evidence of this claim. To me, though, this simply shows that Twitter can be an effective tool for a given strategy &amp;ndash; but that&amp;rsquo;s not automatically the case.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Consider this: Why did organizers execute a given campaign on Twitter and not, say, Identi.ca, FriendFeed, Jaiku or Ping.fm (similar microblogging services) &amp;ndash; or, for that matter, through Facebook statuses or MySpace bulletins?&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>There&amp;rsquo;s a tendency to collapse the strategy and the tool &amp;ndash; to attempt to feast on the fire itself.&lt;/strong> To say, &amp;ldquo;This is what we want to accomplish, and, hey! there&amp;rsquo;s a tool that does that!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and then equate the tool with the strategy. But they&amp;rsquo;re still separate thought processes and separate stages in developing a campaign.&lt;/p> &lt;p>It appears that Twitter was a good tool to use in the cases Jon cited and I mentioned above. But if organizers limit themselves to seeing Twitter as a strategy in and of itself &amp;ndash; without considering the strategy &lt;em>apart&lt;/em> from the tool &amp;ndash; they risk overlooking ways to run a more effective campaign on other platforms, or augmenting a campaign using multiple platforms.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Worse, organizers risk giving supporters feel-good activism that quenches their desire for social change without actually moving the movement closer to a concrete goal, or putting any pressure on powerholders.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>The strategy &lt;em>always&lt;/em> comes first, and &lt;em>then&lt;/em> you figure out which tool fits. The alternative? A forest fire.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Political pamphlets, phone trees and jam-the-faxes must have seemed like strategies in and of themselves when each technology first came out. But a campaign that didn&amp;rsquo;t begin with a strategy to deploy those tools &lt;em>in an effective way&lt;/em> wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been successful.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;real-time coverage&amp;rdquo; use of Twitter, in the style of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXTMob" title="TXTMob, on Wikipedia">TXTMob&lt;/a>, can be effective, and can even form part of the organization of a protest, as it did in the case of the Olympic torch. But that&amp;rsquo;s not a strategy or even a revolution &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s simply street-level news. And in the case of Moldova, the &lt;a href="https://frontlineclub.com/blogs/danielbennett/2009/04/the-myth-of-the-moldova-twitter-revolution.html" title="The myth of the Moldova 'Twitter revolution' by Daniel Bennett">organizing was happening elsewhere&lt;/a>:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>In fact Twitter did not play that big role. The story is quite simple &amp;ndash; young and active bloggers decided to have a flash-mob action, lighting candles and &amp;lsquo;mourning Moldova&amp;rsquo; because of Communists victory, which nobody recognized due to the multiple violations before and during the campaign. They agreed on the time and place of the action through the network of Moldovan blogs (blogs aggregator blogosfera.md), and social networks like Facebook/Odnoklassniki, etc.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>In other words, the most effective &lt;em>tools&lt;/em> to execute the &lt;em>strategy&lt;/em> in question &amp;ndash; organizing opposition to the regime and making it visible to other Moldovans &amp;ndash; didn&amp;rsquo;t include Twitter.&lt;/p> &lt;p>In Evgeny Morozov&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130114225200/http://neteffect.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/04/07/more_analysis_of_twitters_role_in_moldova" title="'More analysis of Twitter's role in Moldova' by Evgeny Morozov">analysis of Twitter in Moldova&lt;/a>, he says:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s really good that the Moldovan students didn&amp;rsquo;t organize this revolution via Friendster or LiveJournal (which is still a platform for choice for many users in Eastern Europe). If they did, they would never have gotten as much attention from the rest of the world.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>This perspective is an example of collapsing the strategy and the tool. More specifically: &lt;strong>Getting attention from the rest of the world is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> automatically the objective of any given social change movement.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Most social change organizers know this. There are moments when you want to focus on building awareness and/or getting media attention, but that&amp;rsquo;s often not the primary focus of the campaign. In the case of the Moldovan students, it could be that what was most needed was a way to get organizers to identify and strategize with one another &amp;ndash; in which case Twitter would have been a very poor (or at least fantastically blunt) tool.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Such perspective is possible only if you think of Twitter as one &lt;em>possible&lt;/em> tool, perfect for use in some strategies and rather ineffective in others. A near-religious belief in Twitter (or any technology) &lt;em>as a strategy&lt;/em> leads to a narrowing of the &lt;em>actual&lt;/em> strategy &amp;ndash; getting the world to pay attention becomes the goal, because, hey, that&amp;rsquo;s what Twitter can be effective at doing!&lt;/p> &lt;p>In this case, organizers might have gotten attention from beyond Moldova with a few dozen Twitterers, but failed at their primary goal of making opposition to the regime visible &lt;em>to other Moldovans&lt;/em>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>As Alan Rosenblatt &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130114225200/http://www.kstreetcafe.com/is-twitter-a-strategy-like-come-on/" title="'Is Twitter a Strategy? Like, Come On!' by Alan Rosenblatt">writes&lt;/a>, different technologies have different ideologies, and tools that are more &amp;ldquo;inherently democratic&amp;rdquo; like Twitter can be used as tools within a strategy that empowers people to a much larger degree than one-way media like television. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t negate the fact that the strategy &amp;ndash; the reason for the campaign itself &amp;ndash; must be laid out first.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Begin with your campaign&amp;rsquo;s strategy &amp;ndash; the food you want to eat. Then determine which technologies will best cultivate the fire within your supporters to achieve the social change you seek.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;em>Update, April 9, 2009: I misattributed something to Jon Pincus that was actually written by Evgeny Morozov.

In one fell swoop, hundreds of political activists&amp;rsquo; online communities were gone, despite the fact that they had been paying for the service.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Why did one system failure take down such a large network? Because the entire project was being &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191123003217/https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2009/01/07/681191/-Why-SoapBlox-Matters" title="Read about the setup, as described on Daily Kos">run by one person&lt;/a>, part-time. These were fairly high-traffic blogs, yet their content was hosted on Soapblox&amp;rsquo;s own servers, and when it all went down, that data became unavailable. After first proclaiming the software &amp;ldquo;dead,&amp;rdquo; developer Paul Preston responded to an outpouring of community support and donations by working to restore the service.&lt;/p> &lt;p>On many lists and other community blogs, discussions have centered on whether it makes sense for these blogs to stay on Soapblox. &amp;ldquo;The consensus that appears to have emerged after a fairly short but very wide-ranging discussion is: it may make sense to transition to another system eventually; for now there is no readily available alternative,&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120705053736/http://mydd.com/2009/1/10/soapblox-meltdown-and-drupal" title="Read 'Soapblox meltdown and Drupal' on MyDD">wrote Shai Sachs at MyDD&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Most of those discussions then devolve into &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal&lt;/a>! No, &lt;a href="https://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress&lt;/a>!&amp;rdquo; with proponents of each sparring over how to construct a community blog similar to Soapblox&amp;rsquo;s core features. I want to refocus the discussion around the underlying issue: &lt;strong>Community blogs simply run better on open-source software, regardless of the platform.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s true that different systems have different features, and one of the attractions of Soapblox was that it offered just want community-blog sites needed out of the box. Setting up community blogs on Drupal or WordPress, both of which I have pretty extensive experience with, is definitely possible, but each requires customization &amp;ndash; something many local activists don&amp;rsquo;t have time or money to do.&lt;/p> &lt;p>There &lt;a href="https://www.acquia.com/" title="Acquia">are&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://mayfirst.coop" title="May First/People Link">many&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090119040137/http://bryght.com/" title="Bryght">companies&lt;/a> that offer &amp;ldquo;hosted&amp;rdquo; versions of open-source software, in the same way that Soapblox (the company) offered a hosted version of Soapblox (the software). So why would I recommend the open-source hosts?&lt;/p> &lt;p>The issue here &amp;ndash; and the difference between these open-source hosts and Soapblox &amp;ndash; is the &lt;strong>gigantic community of open-source developers behind them&lt;/strong>. Soapblox, like these other companies, helps set up hosting and put a friendly face on a somewhat complicated piece of software. But there are hundreds of people working on Drupal that aren&amp;rsquo;t in any way connected to Bryght, or Acquia, or May First &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s something that all of their customers benefit from: new features, continually-upgraded plugins and security fixes.&lt;/p> &lt;p>With a proprietary system, you get only what the company chooses to put out, and only what they have time to put out. Paul has since &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081229235918/http://www.soapblox.net:80/blog/showDiary.do?diaryId=2" title="Read 'Where we stand' on the Soapblox blog">suggested&lt;/a> that &amp;ldquo;SoapBlox needs to be transformed from a proprietary model to one of open source to help get rid of me alone as the single-point of contact with so much stuff.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>I think that&amp;rsquo;s great, and if Soapblox becomes an open-source project then I&amp;rsquo;d definitely recommend it along with other open-source platforms. But the point isn&amp;rsquo;t just to make Paul&amp;rsquo;s life easier, or make him more responsive to customers. &lt;strong>Open-sourcing Soapblox would make the software, and the blogs it hosts, better.&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me? &lt;em>Information Week&lt;/em> magazine wrote a &lt;a href="https://www.informationweek.com/operating-systems/collaboration-is-at-the-heart-of-open-source-content-management" title="Read 'Collaboration Is At The Heart Of Open Source Content Management' from Information Week">cover story&lt;/a> about how businesses are using Drupal and other open-source software, and why:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>Drupal draws on a strength that&amp;rsquo;s common to other successful open source efforts: a vibrant community that drives innovation and lets companies tap the development efforts of thousands of people experimenting with the system.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>Since reviving itself, Soapblox has hired some more people, and that&amp;rsquo;s nice, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, for both Paul and his customers. But the model by which we pay more and more people to maintain our vitally-important software in locked cages just seems poor to me.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Even if Bryght/Acquia/May First went out of business tomorrow, virtually all of its customers could find another vendor to take their system completely intact and get them up and running in an hour or two.&lt;/strong> Soapblox dies, and their customers are stuck in the dark &amp;ndash; if they&amp;rsquo;re lucky they might be able to get a dump of the database and then painstakingly input it into another system.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Open-source communities as the scaffolding for community blogs just seems like a no-brainer to me. I certainly understand the limited time people have and the inertia around a system you already know, but I would hope this might serve as a wake-up call to explore more robust and sustainable systems, be it Drupal or WordPress, Joomla or Plone &amp;ndash; or, if Soapblox takes that route, Soapblox itself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using social networks for social change: Facebook, MySpace and more</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2008/10/using-social-networks-social-change-facebook-myspace-more/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2008/10/using-social-networks-social-change-facebook-myspace-more/</guid><description>&lt;p>I spoke at the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130217190830/http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/103/t/6267/content.jsp?content_KEY=4035">2008 Democracy in Action Community Conference&lt;/a> about the Genocide Intervention Network&amp;rsquo;s use of social networking and social media to achieve our goals in advocacy, fundraising and membership development.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;a href="2008_dia_social-networks-social-change.pdf">Download a PDF of the presentation slides.&lt;/a>&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;em>Update, Nov. 12, 2008: Beth Kanter has &lt;a href="https://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2008/11/social-networks-for-social-change-ivan-boothe-knows-what-he-is-talking-about.html">written up a summary of this presentation over on her blog&lt;/a>.

So it was much more about giving supporters tools to take effective action than it was about convincing people to join our cause. &lt;strong>Social networks are an integral part of an organizing strategy, because communication and engagement are what they&amp;rsquo;re all about.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="weaving-your-social-web" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Weaving Your Social Web&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The dynamics and demographics of each social network are different &amp;ndash; what may make sense on MySpace could be seen as annoying on Facebook. If you have a specific niche, you might try focused networks like &lt;a href="https://blackplanet.com/">BlackPlanet&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090225065839/http://www.eons.com/">Eons&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080208135115/http://www.glee.com/">GLEE&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090213192104/http://www.wiserearth.org/">WiserEarth&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090218155522/http://hub.witness.org/">The Hub&lt;/a> &lt;em>(Update, Aug. 18, 2010: &lt;a href="https://blog.witness.org/2010/08/update-on-the-hub-and-witness-new-online-strategy/">The Hub has been retired&lt;/a>)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>For a sociological study of these different kinds of networks, check out the writings of &lt;a href="https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/">danah boyd&lt;/a>. Interestingly, many nonprofit professionals see Facebook as the &amp;ldquo;more interesting&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;more useful&amp;rdquo; social network as compared to MySpace, and that&amp;rsquo;s largely because, indeed, Facebook is designed to appeal to the predominant class and educational backgrounds of these folks. Depending on an organization&amp;rsquo;s constituency, however, MySpace might actually be a better way to reach your supporters. Don&amp;rsquo;t decide where to organize online based on which site you or your executive director personally think is most appealing.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>When you&amp;rsquo;re determining which network(s) to organize on, the key thing to remember is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be everywhere.&lt;/strong> In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s often better if you start with just one &amp;ndash; get your bearings, try out some different approaches, and become thoughtfully engaged with your community of supporters there. You need to make a commitment to each network you join; there&amp;rsquo;s nothing worse (or more unprofessional looking) than a clearly-abandoned organizational profile, where messages go unanswered and spam comments go unmoderated.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="social-media-and-social-networks" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Social Media and Social Networks&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Social media (e.g. YouTube and Flickr) often integrate particularly well with social networks (e.g. Facebook and MySpace), as a way to help engage members and heighten interest. Why not simply upload your own images and host your own videos? The &amp;ldquo;social&amp;rdquo; in social media ensures that, if you post your media with useful titles, descriptions and keywords, other people may well discover you who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t otherwise have encountered you &amp;ndash; and you&amp;rsquo;ll draw them further into your social web.&lt;/p> &lt;h4 id="using-videos-on-myspace" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Using Videos on MySpace&lt;/span>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>When we first put our profile up on &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090225024644/http://www.myspace.com/genocideintervention">MySpace&lt;/a>, we were getting one or two friend requests a day, and that&amp;rsquo;s not too bad for just starting off. As soon as we put up a short video about the organization &amp;ndash; posted via &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/genocideintervention">YouTube&lt;/a>, in the hopes of drawing in people from that site as well &amp;ndash; our friend requests went up to 10–15 per day. Supporters could embed the videos in their own profiles themselves. That&amp;rsquo;s the advantage of social media in social networks: &lt;strong>People are drawn to photos and video, and the nature of social networking allows them to easily share them with friends.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="keys-to-success-on-social-networks" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Keys to Success on Social Networks&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;ul> &lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s about member engagement.&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;p>You might notice there&amp;rsquo;s only one key: Facilitating conversations &lt;em>between&lt;/em> and &lt;em>among&lt;/em> your supporters. Ultimately, getting an excited base of supporters begins with having them talk to each other about what they&amp;rsquo;re doing around an issue.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s really not a billboard.&lt;/strong> You need to cultivate relationships with your supporters.&lt;/p> &lt;h4 id="the-money-thing" class="link_owner">&lt;span>The Money Thing&lt;/span>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>Social networks are not going to replace your development director. Even when you do raise money, it&amp;rsquo;s usually more about member engagement than it is about a significant revenue stream. GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s experience with Causes, a platform on Facebook and MySpace, was that &amp;ldquo;fundraisers&amp;rdquo; were actually a great way to give supporters something concrete to work toward &amp;ndash; but that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a very significant source of donations. Nonetheless, the social aspect to it ensures that members who &lt;em>do&lt;/em> participate become even more engaged and are often willing to help spearhead the next advocacy campaign.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The top Cause on Facebook had, as of June 2008, more than 3 million members but only raised about $50,000; the vast majority of nonprofits using Causes hadn&amp;rsquo;t raised more than a few hundred dollars. Innovative fundraising campaigns using social networks may bear fruit financially, but member engagement is almost always going to be the primary goal in the end.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="let-your-people-speak" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Let Your People Speak&amp;hellip;&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Causes is also a good illustration of another point: &lt;strong>You need to let your supporters speak for you on social networks.&lt;/strong> GI-Net set up an &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; Cause on Facebook, but a member-created Cause benefiting us has more than twice the number of supporters. We could have tried to shut down the unofficial group in an effort to control our message, but instead we reached out to the creator &amp;ndash; who was more than willing to send out alerts anyway &amp;ndash; and found ways to engage our supporters while still recognizing their own creativity.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The whole &lt;em>point&lt;/em> of the social experience is the coveted &amp;ldquo;recommendation from a friend.&amp;rdquo; Forcing your members to send out only board-approved talking points won&amp;rsquo;t inspire much loyalty, and probably won&amp;rsquo;t be very persuasive to their friends. &lt;strong>Nonprofits have to be willing to &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2008/05/just-what-kind-social-change-are-you-interested" title="Read 'Just what kind of social change are you interested in?'">lose some of their message&lt;/a> control in exchange for member loyalty.&lt;/strong> Trust me &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s worth the trade-off.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="and-then-listen-to-what-they-say" class="link_owner">&lt;span>&amp;hellip;And Then Listen to What They Say&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>On our MySpace profile, we have a prominent newsletter-signup form at the top of the screen. But we don&amp;rsquo;t simply cut-and-paste our blast emails directly to the MySpace crowd. For one of our MySpace blogs, we said the following:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>Are you active in your community on anti-genocide issues? Raising money for civilian protection in Darfur &amp;ndash; educating your neighbors about the mass atrocities in Burma &amp;ndash; working to pass divestment from Sudan in your state? Leave us a comment and describe what you&amp;rsquo;re doing!&lt;/p> &lt;p>We want you in our top friends!&lt;/p> &lt;p>In the coming weeks, we&amp;rsquo;ll be rotating in all of our MySpace friends who are active on anti-genocide issues into our top friends. You&amp;rsquo;ve been supporting us, now we want to support you!&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>On MySpace, putting someone in your &amp;ldquo;top friends&amp;rdquo; is a way of showing thanks and respect, and it was an easy thing to do. We heard from a dozen different local activists who were all featured, some of whom ended up being key leaders on future advocacy campaigns. &lt;strong>Show your supporters that you&amp;rsquo;re listening to them, and they&amp;rsquo;ll reward you!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>This approach &amp;ndash; what&amp;rsquo;s sometimes called &amp;ldquo;user-generated content&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; is a fantastic way to converse with supporters on social networks. Ask people for their stories, photos, videos or other creative work, and then feature some or all of that content. You&amp;rsquo;ll end up with more dedicated members who are willing to take the next step; after having been engaged on a small issue (&amp;ldquo;take a picture of your fundraiser for Darfur&amp;rdquo;) they&amp;rsquo;ll be willing to lead on a larger one (&amp;ldquo;help organize a local visit to your member of Congress&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="success-story-1-using-online-student-pressure-to-pass-legislation" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Success Story 1: Using Online Student Pressure to Pass Legislation&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In 2005, there was an anti-genocide bill that was being held up by a Senate committee chair. Using Facebook, GI-Net identified and reached out to students in that senator&amp;rsquo;s home state.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Instead of having the students contact the senator directly, we guided the students in a process of using the website &lt;a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/">OpenSecrets.org&lt;/a> to determine the senator&amp;rsquo;s top campaign donors. The students called those donors and asked &lt;em>them&lt;/em> to contact the senator and say that standing up against genocide is a moral imperative, and that the senator should move the bill.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The result: Two weeks later, the bill was passed by the committee, was approved by the full Senate, and eventually was signed into law.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="success-story-2-a-photo-petition-puts-students-at-the-heart-of-a-congressional-briefing" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Success Story 2: A Photo Petition Puts Students at the Heart of a Congressional Briefing&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s student division, &lt;a href="https://standnow.org/">STAND&lt;/a>, initiated a campaign called &amp;ldquo;Picture a World Without Genocide,&amp;rdquo; in which they encouraged high school students to submit photos via Facebook and MySpace of their activism on Darfur. Hundreds of pictures were collected and compiled into a large poster spelling out the word &amp;ldquo;Darfur.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>We presented this poster at a Capitol Hill briefing, in conjunction with a report we were releasing about congressional action on Darfur. We had prepared the report, and originally we were going to do a traditional press conference in which we called out Congress for their inaction.&lt;/p> &lt;p>We decided to couple the release of this report with this visible manifestation of student activism, as a way to keep our members engaged. In the weeks following the event, the numbers of co-sponsors for key legislation increased substantially &amp;ndash; and &lt;strong>because students had been &amp;ldquo;part of the action,&amp;rdquo; they were able to claim part of the victory&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>In fact, even if no new co-sponsors had signed on, the action still would have been a great way to activate supporters, so it was really a no-lose campaign for us.&lt;/p> &lt;h4 id="a-worldwide-photo-gallery-in-24-hours" class="link_owner">&lt;span>A Worldwide Photo Gallery in 24 Hours&lt;/span>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>When coordinated rallies focusing on Darfur were set up by the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120202182016/http://www.savedarfur.org/">Save Darfur Coalition&lt;/a> (of which GI-Net is a part), we encouraged our members to take part &amp;ndash; and take pictures. Then we had them upload their images to the photosharing site &lt;a href="https://flickr.com/photos/genocideintervention">Flickr&lt;/a>, along with a special tag, or keyword, for that event. Using Flickr&amp;rsquo;s own system, we could then pull images with that tag onto GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s website in a constantly-updated, rotating gallery of Darfur activism the day after the event.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Total time on our part? About 15 minutes to write the email to our members, and 10 minutes to put the gallery on our website.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="success-story-3-how-social-networks-can-coordinate-a-fundraising-drive" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Success Story 3: How Social Networks Can Coordinate a Fundraising Drive&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>STAND&amp;rsquo;s annual &amp;ldquo;DarfurFast&amp;rdquo; encourages students on one day to refrain from one luxury item, and donate the proceeds to GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s Darfur protection program. We engage people around the campaign on several different channels, including Facebook, MySpace, &lt;a href="https://endgenocide.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/antigenocide">Twitter&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Social networks were a key way to keep supporters engaged &amp;ndash; as well as inviting friends on campus to take part in the real-world upcoming events. &lt;strong>The key is that the person-to-person networks already existed in the form of chapters and campus networks&lt;/strong>; online social networks simply facilitated an easier invitation to friends.&lt;/p> &lt;p>So, we raised more than $500,000 over the course of three years with this event; 2007 saw participation from 450 high schools and 300 colleges. But it&amp;rsquo;s very unlikely we would have ever raised that kind of money via Facebook et al. alone &amp;ndash; the online social networks simply supplemented the on-the-ground organizing we (and campus leaders) had already been doing. In fact, online social networks are probably &lt;em>most&lt;/em> strategically useful when the event is offline, allowing supporters to quickly spread the word well ahead of time.&lt;/p> &lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that many of these methods worked particularly well because they centered on students, who are most active on these networks, generally have easy access to computers and are more likely to have free time. While GI-Net has a constituency far beyond students alone (and sometimes reaches those constituencies directly through networks like Eons), you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily expect these kinds of returns from everyone. As noted above, working-class communities, communities of color, folks with less formal education and various kinds of &amp;ldquo;marginalized&amp;rdquo; groups interact with online social networks very differently, often because of stronger real-world social networks. The best organizing strategy activates people through all their social connections, whether online or offline.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="final-thoughts" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Final Thoughts&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;ul> &lt;li>&lt;strong>Engaging supporters on social networks is long-term.&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t expect immediate results.&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;strong>It takes effort.&lt;/strong> You need to be willing to communicate, in both directions, with your supporters.&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;strong>If you want your members to spread your message, you have to trust them.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;p>Feedback in the comments below is welcome!

How it works is fantastically simple: When you go to a website, Firefox displays a notification bar at the top of the page, for corporations that have business practices that you might be concerned about, as well as a link to read more. The extension also displays visual notifications in search engine results, marking links to corporations of concern.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>The Genocide Intervention Network&amp;rsquo;s proposal is an anti-genocide legislation tracker and widget system &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080719230742/http://www.netsquared.org/2008/conference/projects/anti-genocide-action-tracker-genocide-scores-every-politician-state-and-university" title="View the NetSquared proposal">developed by Ivan Boothe&lt;/a>.

question: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080724112756/http://www.netsquared.org/blog/britt-bravo/join-net2thinktank-what-if-anything-does-all-clicking-blogging-and-friending-add-end">Is Online Activism Good for Social Change?&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>As someone who was quoted in the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080923000521/http://www.socialcitizens.org/paper">&amp;ldquo;Social Citizens&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> report and has written in the past about technology and social change, my answer to that question would certainly be &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>But I think the question is significantly complicated in the question from Allison Fine, author of &amp;ldquo;Social Citizens&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>Is our tendency to connect only with like-minded people using our online and on land social networks a good thing for activism or a critical bottleneck to the effective scaling for causes?&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>Put another way I think it could be asked: &lt;strong>Online activism is good for social change &amp;ndash; but what kind of social change?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Many nonprofits use social networks and online activism as a way to boost their membership rolls and donation levels. As I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2007/10/organizing-rather-mobilizing-using-social-networks-constituency-building">written before&lt;/a>, that seems less useful to me than focusing on empowering an effective movement &amp;ndash; whether or not people donate to your organization or sign up for your newsletter. This isn&amp;rsquo;t to minimize the challenges everyone faces on how to support working for social change, both financially and emotionally. But it is to say that &lt;strong>movements are bigger than any one nonprofit&lt;/strong>. Certainly, organizations can ignore that and focus on using MySpace to get new email addresses and Facebook to drum up donations &amp;ndash; but frankly, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that has a lot to do with social change.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Only when the &lt;em>operational&lt;/em> concerns are placed secondary to &lt;em>social change&lt;/em> concerns do I see social change really being possible.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s not a secondary outcome; it has to be the primary concern. And that&amp;rsquo;s true, in my opinion, whether you&amp;rsquo;re talking about online or offline social change.&lt;/p> &lt;p>More than thirty years ago, sociologists Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward wrote in the introduction to &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=cAlHAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;q=poor+people%27s+movements&amp;amp;dq=poor+people%27s+movements&amp;amp;pgis=1">&lt;em>Poor People&amp;rsquo;s Movements: Why They Succeed, How They Fail&lt;/em>&lt;/a> (1977):&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>[D]uring those brief moments when lower-class groups exert some force against the state, those who call themselves leaders do not usually escalate the momentum of the people&amp;rsquo;s protests. They do not because they are preoccupied with trying to build and sustain embryonic formal organizations in the sure conviction that these organizations will enlarge and become powerful.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>More recently, members of the collective INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence published the scathing &lt;a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-revolution-will-not-be-funded">&lt;em>The Revolution Will Not Be Funded: Beyond the Non-Profit Industrial Complex&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, which excoriated the nonprofit system &amp;ndash; primarily foundations, but also the kind of institutionalized dissent Piven and Cloward explored above &amp;ndash; for perpetuating the social inequity they say they want to end.&lt;/p> &lt;p>In the 1970s and &amp;rsquo;80s, rising social inequality helped hasten a breakdown of both communities and community struggles. (We &amp;ldquo;Millennials&amp;rdquo; of which Fine writes were, of course, originally termed &amp;ldquo;Reagan Babies.&amp;rdquo;) Poor people&amp;rsquo;s movements Piven and Cloward explore were co-opted and defused by top-down organizers from large nonprofits. And family foundations, rooted back in the (first) Gilded Age and gaining power in the tech booms of the 1990s, helped professionalize the practice of dissent. Or as Patrick Reinsborough writes in an oft-quoted essay, &lt;a href="https://www.joaap.org/1/de_colonizing/index.html">&amp;ldquo;De-Colonizing the Revolutionary Imagination&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>Just as service oriented NGO&amp;rsquo;s have been tapped to fill the voids left by the state or the market, so have social change NGO&amp;rsquo;s arisen to streamline the chaotic business of dissent. Let&amp;rsquo;s call this trend NGOism, that terrifyingly widespread conceit among professional &amp;ldquo;campaigners&amp;rdquo; that social change is a highly specialized profession best left to experienced strategists, negotiators and policy wonks. NGOism is the conceit that paid staff will be enough to save the world.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>Some nonprofits, older and more institutionalized, are wary of giving their members &amp;ldquo;control&amp;rdquo; of their &amp;ldquo;message&amp;rdquo; in the realm of social networks and social media. Mostly, I think that&amp;rsquo;s nothing more than a fear of losing power. When you think you know how to change the world, it can be hard for some people to want to involve others &amp;ndash; or give anyone else the credit.&lt;/p> &lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is that this time around, there&amp;rsquo;s a significantly higher ability for activists to self-organize. &lt;strong>The message to nonprofits from activists in the past few years seems pretty clear: Stand in our way, and we&amp;rsquo;ll just go around you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>The 2006 student walkouts for immigrant rights &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/28/AR2006032800982.html">spread through MySpace without any &amp;ldquo;sponsoring&amp;rdquo; organization&lt;/a>. As I explained in a &lt;a href="https://www.slideshare.net/forumone/ivan-boothe-v2">presentation on Facebook&lt;/a>, when the Genocide Intervention Network first arrived on the scene, we found dozens of existing groups and networks already active &amp;ndash; our objective was simply to connect them and provide them with &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071013185105/http://www.1800genocide.com/">effective&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080708201835/http://www.darfurscores.org/">tools&lt;/a> for action. A participant in the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14586563">protests over the Jena Six&lt;/a> said, &amp;ldquo;I am so disappointed with the media right now. I live in Connecticut and I never even heard of this. Honestly if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for Facebook, I still wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;p>So the question really goes to the nonprofits and other groups using social networks and social media:&lt;/p> &lt;ul> &lt;li>&lt;strong>What kind of social change do you want?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;strong>Are you willing to help facilitate even if you don&amp;rsquo;t get credit, coverage, or donations?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;p>That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; nonprofits can&amp;rsquo;t work for social change through technology, or that only unsupported volunteers can really make things better &amp;ndash; as Reinsborough puts it in the corollary to the comment above:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>This is not to say that corporate campaigns and winning concessions is merely &amp;ldquo;reformist&amp;rdquo; and therefore not important. The simplistic dichotomy of reform versus revolution often hides the privilege of &amp;ldquo;radicals&amp;rdquo; who have the luxury of refusing concessions when it&amp;rsquo;s not their community or ecosystem that is on the chopping block.&lt;/p> &lt;p>A more important distinction is which direction is the concession moving towards? Is it a concession that releases pressure on the system and thereby legitimizes illegitimate authority? Or is it a concession that teaches people a lesson about grassroots power building and therefore brings us closer to systemic social change?&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not as worried about whether, as Fine asks, the &amp;ldquo;tendency to connect only with like-minded people&amp;rdquo; puts limitations on what can be achieved. Most social change movements, including the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709093103/http://tinyurl.com/4xaffs" title="The Origins of the Civil Rights Movement: Black Communities Organizing for Social Change, by Aldon D.

Lullabot, a Drupal development firm that involved in much of the Drupal development, has a &lt;a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/how-drupal-will-save-the-world">keen interest in Drupal for nonprofits&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>In return for NetSquared&amp;rsquo;s generosity, I wanted to post some tips for nonprofits thinking about using Drupal for their sites. I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that, under most circumstances, Drupal can be a powerful resource for online advocacy and social change.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="background" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Background&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>To date, I have built four full-fledged sites with Drupal for the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080804233456/http://www.genocideintervention.net/">Genocide Intervention Network&lt;/a>:&lt;/p> &lt;ul> &lt;li>&lt;a data-dead-link="http://www.askthecandidates.org" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/dead-link/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.askthecandidates.org" title="http://www.askthecandidates.org [dead link]" >Ask the Candidates&lt;/a > (Drupal version 5)&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080801050841/http://www.darfurscores.org/">Darfur Congressional Scorecard&lt;/a> (v4.7)&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070208211701/http://www.timetoprotect.org/">Time to Protect&lt;/a> (v4.7)&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a data-dead-link="http://www.powertoprotect.org" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/dead-link/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.powertoprotect.org" title="http://www.powertoprotect.org [dead link]" >Power to Protect&lt;/a > (v4.6)&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;p>GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080804233456/http://www.genocideintervention.net/">main site&lt;/a> was also developed in Drupal (v4.7) by an outside firm, as was GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s student site, &lt;a href="https://standnow.org/">STAND&lt;/a> (v4.7).&lt;/p> &lt;p>My &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312021724/http://www.quixoticlife.net/">personal site&lt;/a> is in Drupal (v5) and I&amp;rsquo;m working on releasing an e-commerce site and a community events site in the near future.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Although I have a working knowledge of basic PHP, on which Drupal is based, my work primarily is in HTML and CSS &amp;ndash; for the majority of things our sites need to do, it&amp;rsquo;s mainly a matter of finding the right modules (plugins) and then themeing (designing) the site to look the way we want. By and large you don&amp;rsquo;t need to have a lot of programming knowledge to create effective sites in Drupal.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="when-to-use-drupal----and-when-not-to-use-it" class="link_owner">&lt;span>When to Use Drupal &amp;ndash; and When Not to Use it&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Drupal has a number of strengths:&lt;/p> &lt;ul> &lt;li>Once you understand the terminology and basic structure of Drupal, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to set up sites relatively quickly, with advanced functionality simply &amp;ldquo;dropped in&amp;rdquo; by way of modules.&lt;/li> &lt;li>Drupal is relatively easy to theme, especially in version 5 and even more so in the upcoming version 6 (likely to be released in early 2008).&lt;/li> &lt;li>Drupal is extremely search-engine friendly, helping get your site to the top of search engine lists with minimal effort. With a few tweaks and additional modules, it can be even more effective.&lt;/li> &lt;li>Drupal is relatively scalable, able to power large sites as well as small. For very high-traffic sites, this will take some tweaking of the server settings, but this is true for pretty much any content management system (CMS).&lt;/li> &lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s free! More importantly, it has a large, robust community of developers regularly updating both its core features and plug-in modules &amp;ndash; also for free! And when you can&amp;rsquo;t swing the free-software cost &amp;ndash; staff time &amp;ndash; there are plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-services">Drupal developers&lt;/a> out there. For nonprofits looking to &amp;ldquo;act out&amp;rdquo; social change, Drupal is a welcome addition to for-profit corporations upon which you have to depend for any updates or bug fixes.&lt;/li> &lt;li>Because it&amp;rsquo;s open-source, Drupal won&amp;rsquo;t lock you in to a proprietary system that mangles your data or makes it difficult to switch to another CMS in the future. Additionally, it&amp;rsquo;s open nature allows for more frequent integration with other software and web services &amp;ndash; everything from &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr&lt;/a> to &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce&lt;/a>, with rumors of &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080806144433/http://www2.democracyinaction.org/">Democracy in Action&lt;/a> on the way.&lt;/li> &lt;li>Of special note, Drupal has tight integration with &lt;a href="https://civicrm.org/">CiviCRM&lt;/a> and equally free, open-source contact relationship manager (also available for the &lt;a href="https://www.joomla.org/">Joomla CMS&lt;/a>). If you opt to use CiviCRM as your CRM for donors or members, you can aggregate useful data like donations through the website, membership dues, attendance at events, subscriptions to mailing lists and participation in local groups, as well as the usual searching, sorting and categorizing of contacts available in any CRM.&lt;/li> &lt;li>For you geeks out there, it uses standards compliant (at least in core) semantic code and is built on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC&lt;/a> model.&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;p>Many prominent sites, both commercial and nonprofit, have been built on Drupal, including &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080801192132/http://www.mtv.co.uk/">MTV.co.uk&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080805060144/http://dodd.senate.gov/">Sen. Chris Dodd&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080108234632/http://www.theonion.com/content/index">The Onion&lt;/a> and NetSquared itself (&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080805075701/http://www.netsquared.org/">see a full list&lt;/a>).&lt;/p> &lt;p>One of my favorites, just recently released, is WITNESS&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071220024321/http://hub.witness.org/">The Hub&lt;/a>, built by the fine folks at &lt;a href="https://civicactions.com/">CivicActions&lt;/a>. (The Hub was also a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070817032657/http://www.netsquared.org/projects/proposals/hub">proposal&lt;/a> for the 2007 NetSquared Conference.) I think The Hub really shows the potential for social change that Drupal-powered sites can accomplish.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>When might you not want to use Drupal?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;ul> &lt;li>For those completely new to Drupal, it can have a significant learning curve. We&amp;rsquo;re not talking Photoshop here, but much of the terminology and structure of the site can be unfamiliar to new users, even those familiar with other CMSes. If you need a hot website tomorrow and can&amp;rsquo;t spring for a paid developer, it might make more sense to go with a CMS you already know.&lt;/li> &lt;li>Drupal is an excellent platform for blogs, and allows you to build in a lot of community and social-networking features that can strengthen your blog&amp;rsquo;s appeal. However, &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress&lt;/a>, another free open-source software, is specifically oriented toward blogs. The learning curve is significantly less, and it&amp;rsquo;s somewhat easier to theme (design). If you&amp;rsquo;re primarily a designer and you want a straightforward blog site without having to ever see a line of PHP code, WordPress may well be a better option. Like Drupal, it has an excellent community of developers and contributers, and many of its plugins can also stretch its capabilities to encompass social-networking-oriented functions.&lt;/li> &lt;li>If you absolutely need a website tomorrow &amp;ndash; a simple blog or &amp;ldquo;brochureware&amp;rdquo; site giving the basics of a new campaign and a place to post updates and press releases, your best bet may be &lt;a href="https://www.joomla.org/">Joomla&lt;/a>. Like Drupal and WordPress, it&amp;rsquo;s free, open-source and has lots of developers, many of them involved in nonprofits and advocacy campaigns. It is somewhat harder to design to not look like &amp;ldquo;a Joomla site&amp;rdquo; but there&amp;rsquo;s no question that it&amp;rsquo;s faster to set up and publish a simple website.&lt;/li> &lt;li>Free software is great and all, but if you have no budget and no design or programming resources in-house, you may want to stick with that commercial CMS you know &amp;ndash; or even Dreamweaver or FrontPage sites. The cost of free software is the development time, and that isn&amp;rsquo;t an insignificant concern. If you&amp;rsquo;re planning a big campaign and have a budget or in-house developers, I highly recommend one of the open-source CMSes because of all of the strengths mentioned above (and particularly that they won&amp;rsquo;t lock you into some horrible proprietary code nightmare). But not every nonprofit will have that luxury, and you should carefully consider if you have the money or staff time to build a site from scratch.&lt;/li> &lt;li>Above, I mentioned that many Drupal modules offer integration with other software and web services. This is true, but not for every piece of software out there, and not always as robustly as you might like. In particular, if you have a lot of tight integration needs and already have another piece hosted with another service &amp;ndash; a donor database or an online action suite, for instance &amp;ndash; it may make sense to build your website using their own CMS to allow for the tightest possible integration. You&amp;rsquo;ll give up some of the cool Drupal functionality and customization possibilities, but when it comes time to run those end-year reports, you just push a button.&lt;/li> &lt;li>Drupal is built by volunteers. Some of them are paid web developers who voluntarily contribute their work back to the Drupal community. But nothing is guaranteed &amp;ndash; that module you depend on might have a bug that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get fixed for six months. There are ways to help guard against this &amp;ndash; for instance, by sticking to modules &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080805011707/http://www.lullabot.com/audiocast/drupal_podcast_no_40_top_40_projects">recommended&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080803004646/http://webpodge.com/2007/02/22/top-10-drupal-modules/">others&lt;/a>, and checking to see how often past releases have come out, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely something to consider. In all of the sites I&amp;rsquo;ve built Drupal on, only one mission-critical item has ever had a serious bug that took a couple of months to get addressed. That said, if you do have developers on hand or can pay others, Drupal&amp;rsquo;s open-source nature makes it easy to find and squash the bugs yourself as they occur &amp;ndash; no waiting on Kintera or Convio to get around to fixing your pet peeve with the software.&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;h3 id="drupal-resources-for-nonprofits" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Drupal Resources for Nonprofits&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://groups.drupal.org/drupal-for-good">Drupal for Good&lt;/a> is the primary Drupal-centered site for nonprofit and charitable discussions.

There are plenty of &lt;a href="https://groups.drupal.org/og/all?filter0=&amp;amp;filter1=141&amp;amp;filter2=**ALL**">geographically-based Drupal groups&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; see if there&amp;rsquo;s one near you!&lt;/p> &lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s lots of general Drupal support out there, including the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080629032329/http://drupal.org/handbooks">handbook documentation&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080612200622/http://drupal.org/lists">mailing lists&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://drupal.org/node/108355">IRC&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/forum">forums&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/planet">blogs&lt;/a>. (If you have questions about a specific module, the best practice is to go to that module&amp;rsquo;s project page on Drupal and post an issue &amp;ndash; among other things, it&amp;rsquo;s far more likely your questions or concerns will be answered than if you post on the general forums!)

It&amp;rsquo;s true that someone could start posting pictures on Flickr of irrelevant things and tag them &amp;ldquo;antigenocide,&amp;rdquo; or that some of our biggest fans hosting the YouTube video on MySpace might have profiles that would make some of our donors cringe.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Perhaps even more significantly, it&amp;rsquo;s possible that some of the people who encounter us on these sites never make it to our main website, never sign up for a newsletter, never complete an action, and never make a donation.&lt;/p> &lt;p>For us, it goes back to our mission: to empower our members to prevent and stop genocide, and in so doing, to create an educated anti-genocide constituency.&lt;/p> &lt;p>While we do, of course, want to increase our membership rolls and make ever-larger donations to civilian protection, in some respects it&amp;rsquo;s not always necessary for people to perform every anti-genocide action through our organization.&lt;/p> &lt;p>If our videos or emails or profiles get people talking more substantially about genocide &amp;ndash; and the concrete ways in which they can actually prevent and stop genocide &amp;ndash; then in some sense whether they end up on our mailing list is somewhat beside the point. Through their knowledge they will engage others, and ultimately enhance the anti-genocide movement we&amp;rsquo;re helping to build.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>In his &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080621134439/http://www.personaldemocracy.com/node/1116">profile&lt;/a> of GI-Net and Catalyst Campaigns, Joshua Levy describes this approach as &amp;ldquo;similar to bottom-up, open-source collaborative projects,&amp;rdquo; and I think that&amp;rsquo;s exactly right. Our organization is engaged in a collaborative project with our members, and while we may have particular resources or acquired expertise, it&amp;rsquo;s really their activism and passion that will build and drive the movement.&lt;/p> &lt;p>What it all comes down to is that we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on organizing people into a permanent anti-genocide movement (and much of that happens in a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080516033252/http://www.idealware.org/articles/participatory_tools.php">decentralized, self-organized&lt;/a> sort of way) rather than simply mobilizing people for a particular event or campaign and then sending them home. If you just need bodies at a rally, names on a petition or donations in your coffers, &lt;strong>mobilizing&lt;/strong> through traditional means will work great. But if you need an active, educated and effective movement, &lt;strong>organizing&lt;/strong> through social webs has the potential to create much more lasting change.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="the-genocide-intervention-network-on-the-social-web" class="link_owner">&lt;span>The Genocide Intervention Network on the Social Web&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;ul> &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080726053628/http://myspace.com/genocideintervention">MySpace&lt;/a>&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a data-dead-link="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2204803189" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/dead-link/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgroup.php%3Fgid%3D2204803189" title="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2204803189 [dead link]" >Facebook&lt;/a >&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070501040009/http://www.change.org/genocideintervention">change.org&lt;/a>&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://endgenocide.livejournal.com/profile">LiveJournal&lt;/a>&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/antigenocide">Twitter&lt;/a>&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://flickr.com/photos/genocideintervention">Flickr&lt;/a>&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/genocideintervention">YouTube&lt;/a>&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;h3 id="previous-articles" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Previous Articles&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;ul> &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070612180331/http://www.idealware.org/articles/social_networking_genocide.php">Using Social Networking to Stop Genocide&lt;/a> (Idealware), on the origins of GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s approach.&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2006/12/theory-bottom-social-networking">Bottom-up social networking interview&lt;/a>, on why MySpace isn&amp;rsquo;t like banner ads (see the second half).&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080724202531/http://www.americanprogressaction.org/events/2007/noi.html">Leveraging Social Networks for Progressive Organizing&lt;/a> (New Organizing Institute), a panel discussion I was on talking about the possibilities for nonprofits using social networks.

You can see our action in the message below, or by going to:&lt;/p> &lt;a data-dead-link="http://www.GenocideIntervention.net/OneMinute" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/dead-link/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.GenocideIntervention.net%2FOneMinute" title="http://www.GenocideIntervention.net/OneMinute [dead link]" >GenocideIntervention.net/OneMinute&lt;/a > &lt;p>Prior to this action, we used Collactive twice to promote particular op-eds (one in the &lt;em>Boston Globe&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080303224037/http://www.collactive.com/success_ginet.html">here&amp;rsquo;s a writeup&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; and one in the &lt;em>LA Times&lt;/em>) that aligned with our positions on how to stop genocide in Darfur. We had our members email the articles, via Collactive (which steps you through the process), and quickly raised them to the &amp;ldquo;most emailed&amp;rdquo; spot on the home page.&lt;/p> &lt;p>In the case of the &lt;em>LA Times&lt;/em> article, which was about the need for divestment from Sudan, we had our members specifically email the article to a vice-president at Fidelity, which has a lot of investments in Sudan-linked business firms. So in that case, we got a two-for-one &amp;ndash; both raising awareness of the issue and flooding a decisionmaker with an important column. You can read more about these successes in &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070702053010/http://genocideintervention.net/members/newsletter/index.php/2007-05/29/">our recent supporter newsletter&lt;/a> (see &amp;ldquo;The One Minute Action&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p> &lt;p> &lt;figure> &lt;picture> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2007/07/one-minute-1-800-genocide/1800genocide.avif" type="image/avif"> &lt;source srcset="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2007/07/one-minute-1-800-genocide/1800genocide.webp" type="image/webp"> &lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="1-800-GENOCIDE" class="image_figure image_internal image_processed" width="486" height="140" src="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/blog/2007/07/one-minute-1-800-genocide/1800genocide.jpg" title=" " /> &lt;/picture> &lt;/figure> &lt;/p> &lt;p>In this case, we are asking our members to vote up an article on our anti-genocide hotline, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070210072326/http://www.1800genocide.com/">1-800-GENOCIDE&lt;/a>, on the social bookmarking website Reddit. We just sent this out a few hours ago, so things are still developing. Collactive also has ways to focus your network&amp;rsquo;s power on YouTube videos, Digg articles and specific blog entries (for instance, to flood a blog with positive or negative comments).&lt;/p> &lt;p>We have been pretty happy with Collactive so far; if anyone has any questions about these campaigns I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to relate our experiences.

(This ad campaign would also show up in &lt;strong>Marty&lt;/strong>&amp;rsquo;s presentation.)&lt;/p> &lt;p>Colin pointed out that Chevy had decided to leave the ads online because they had the effect of driving lots of traffic to the website &amp;ndash; thus turning a negative backlash into a positive result. In his presentation, however, Marty said there had been a significant drop in sales of the Tahoe the next quarter &amp;ndash; possibly due to the rise in gas prices, but possibly also due to this negative publicity.&lt;/p> &lt;p>After recommending that campaigns engage in participatory media for the simple reason that your users are doing it anyway (giving the example of the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h3G-lMZxjo">vote different&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; video), Colin outlined the basic motivations:&lt;/p> &lt;ul> &lt;li>engagement&lt;/li> &lt;li>leveraging collective intelligence (Marty might call this being network-centric)&lt;/li> &lt;li>publicity&lt;/li> &lt;li>because they&amp;rsquo;re there&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;p>Colin pointed out that email discussion lists and fora were a basic form of user-generated content. Beyond that lay blogs, then video and photographs, altered images, stories, social networking projects and &amp;ldquo;ideas&amp;rdquo; themselves.&lt;/p> &lt;p>There are several levels of engagement possible with participatory media:&lt;/p> &lt;ul> &lt;li>observation (one-way, receiving information)&lt;/li> &lt;li>interaction (responding with information, as in a blog comment)&lt;/li> &lt;li>contribution (creating information, as in posting a blog)&lt;/li> &lt;li>solicitation (asking others to create information in response to yours, as in a video response or a contest)&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;p>A prime example of participatory media that Colin gave was Late Night with Conan O&amp;rsquo;Brien&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070705204729/http://www.hornymanatee.com/">HornyManatee.com&lt;/a>. The site solicits hot manatee action from its users, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070127151216/http://www.hornymanatee.com:80/fan_art/8017.shtml">to great effect&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Michael&lt;/strong> then took the helm, demonstrating two participatory media campaigns EchoDitto had worked on (which coincidentally both &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071028185218/http://www.echoditto.com/node/1063">won awards&lt;/a>): &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070719052759/http://www.sinceslicedbread.com/">Since Sliced Bread&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630001236/http://www.pearlharborstories.org/">Pearl Harbor Survivors Project&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>For the Survivors Project, Michael talked about the strategizing they had done in order to collect the stories of the several-hundred remaining survivors of the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. They had set up a toll-free number so that technologically-challenged seniors wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to interface with the website, but to their surprise that was the primary mode of submission. In another twist, they established a MySpace profile not expecting much response from a youthful crowd, but soon went on to find 20,000 friend requests.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Michael pointed out that the nature of participatory media was still new enough that it is able to earn media for the organization &amp;ndash; the Survivors Project really took off after a feature in Parade. The very existence of the campaign was a news story, in a way a traditional museum-style exhibit on Pearl Harbor would not be.&lt;/p> &lt;p>As for Since Sliced Bread, Michael explained that it was an attempt by &lt;a href="https://seiu.org/">SEIU&lt;/a> president Andy Stern to solicit ideas directly from workers, because he felt like DC lobbyists and consultants working on labor issues weren&amp;rsquo;t concerned with the real issues facing his union members.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Users were thus invited to submit their best ideas Since Sliced Bread, with the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070719053813/http://www.sinceslicedbread.com/idea/9602">winner&lt;/a> receiving a prize of $100,000 and runners-up receiving money as well. The project had what Michael called &amp;ldquo;a panel of sort-of celebrities&amp;rdquo; which narrowed the tens-of-thousands of entries to a slate of 21 finalists. The community then voted on the winners from those 21.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Michael talked about the issues confronted by the team when losers in the contest turned against the site &amp;ndash; a much higher volume of nasty blog comments, to the point that the blog became de-emphasized on the site to try to remove the flashpoint. The site also generated some serious victories as well, including the winning project going on to being approved by voters in a Washington state ballot initiative.&lt;/p> &lt;p>In the question-and-answer period, numerous participatory media campaigns were offered, including the March of Dimes' &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070717211439/http://www.shareyourstory.org/">Share Your Story&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070610082243/http://picturethecure.ca/">Picture the Cure&lt;/a> (cached copy, site seems down) initiative for the Canadian Cancer Society. &lt;strong>Alan Rosenblatt&lt;/strong> said &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070706210219/http://www.care2.com/">Care2&lt;/a> had done a study demonstrating that people who participated in discussion fora were 74% more likely to take action.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="on-to-the-second-session" class="link_owner">&lt;span>On to the second session!&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Marty&lt;/strong> began by making the argument that the differences in social networks (connections) today &amp;ndash; aptly covered by &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205054343/netsquared.org/blog/britt-bravo/notes-ntc-keynote-david-weinberger">David Weinberger&lt;/a> earlier in the day &amp;ndash; should necessarily change the way we go about social organizing. It is not as much about building individual leadership or organizational capacity, he said, but about making strong and effective connections.&lt;/p> &lt;p>In other words, what would your organization do with 10,000 people for ten minutes?&lt;/p> &lt;p>Most people today are under a barrage of information. When the FCC&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/">Do Not Call&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; list was launched, 50 million people signed up in just a few weeks &amp;ndash; without any advertising whatsoever. These people have &amp;ldquo;walked away from the current models of civic engagement.&amp;rdquo; They don&amp;rsquo;t sign up for email lists because they&amp;rsquo;re afraid of ever getting off &amp;ndash; a barrier to exit becomes a barrier to entry.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Network-centric advocacy focuses not only on the individual or organization, but more importantly on the network &amp;ldquo;as a mechanism for exerting influence.&amp;rdquo; Recent political examples of this include the Gray Davis recall campaign, the Howard Dean presidential campaign, and the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070708232229/http://www.networkforjustice.org/partners/New_Yorkers_Against_The_Death_Penalty">Network for Justice Against the Death Penalty&lt;/a> campaign, which used an innovative evite.com-style model for encouraging people to encourage their friends to sign up (and publicly display the results). A more visual example is &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070714124801/http://forwardtrack.eyebeamresearch.org/">ForwardTrack&lt;/a>, recently deployed by the Oxygen network in &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070716232054/http://speakup.oxygen.com/campaigns/womensrights/">Oh!

(Scott was also the person who originally contacted GI-Net about collaborating with the band &lt;a href="http://www.anti-flag.com/">Anti-Flag&lt;/a> on a Darfur essay included in their newest album.)&lt;/p> &lt;p>One thing I have been emphasizing in all of these presentations and interviews has been the idea of &lt;strong>using social networking as a &amp;ldquo;bottom-up&amp;rdquo; way of online mobilization&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; in the words of GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s mission, &amp;ldquo;empowering individuals and communities with the tools&amp;rdquo; to effect change.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Salient quote from &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070717032434/http://www.personaldemocracy.com/node/1116">Joshua&amp;rsquo;s article&lt;/a>:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>Offering concrete ideas for how to solve a seemingly insurmountable problem can give people a sense that they, as individuals, have a stake in an issue.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The Genocide Intervention Network links to a list of &amp;ldquo;ten things you can do to stop genocide.&amp;rdquo; Ivan Boothe argues that these steps, broken down into easily digestible chunks, give people an easy way to participate.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Although they also link to the Genocide Intervention Network&amp;rsquo;s main web site, that isn&amp;rsquo;t always the point. &amp;ldquo;A number of these steps aren&amp;rsquo;t even within our organization,&amp;rdquo; Boothe says. This sort of advocacy is similar to bottom-up, open-source collaborative projects like Wikipedia, in which no one group has proprietary ownership over an idea or a product; instead, the goal is a constant generation of awareness and ideas.&lt;/p> &lt;p>A MySpace page, says Boothe, isn&amp;rsquo;t simply an advertisement for an organization, &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s a tool for mobilizing people for different kinds of action.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t by any means consider myself an expert (personally I find myself less interested in MySpace than you might expect &amp;ndash; but then again I&amp;rsquo;m a techie who hates cell phones, so maybe that&amp;rsquo;s not a surprise) but I do think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to be accomplished in this space.&lt;/p> &lt;p>I think organizations just have to stay focused on empowering their members rather than simply advertising to them, and really being willing engaging them in a constructive way.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Many of the &lt;a data-dead-link="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/79084/myspace_brings_humanitarian_organization.html" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/dead-link/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.associatedcontent.com%2Farticle%2F79084%2Fmyspace_brings_humanitarian_organization.html" title="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/79084/myspace_brings_humanitarian_organization.html [dead link]" >approaches to social networking&lt;/a > seem to involve nothing more than acquiring banner space:&lt;/p> &lt;blockquote> &lt;p>If anyone out in the world needs help, all they have to do is look to MySpace. You just have to get up on the wall at MySpace, and represent. Good things will happen.&lt;/p> &lt;/blockquote> &lt;p>Yes, you can reach a large audience with MySpace, and statistically, with a large enough audience you will have talented people volunteer their services. But that&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;social networking,&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s just advertising &amp;ndash; if nonprofits could easily and cheaply fly banner advertisements behind airplanes in the world&amp;rsquo;s major cities, they would probably get a lot of volunteers, too. The only difference in this case is that it&amp;rsquo;s electronic and (relatively) free.&lt;/p> &lt;p>And &amp;ndash; as our organization has certainly found out &amp;ndash; getting a lot of volunteers often means getting a lot of people wanting to do things you don&amp;rsquo;t do or can&amp;rsquo;t do (like volunteering to go to Darfur, or raising money for guns for rebels, or adopting orphaned Darfurian children). Getting a lot of exposure all of a sudden can overwhelm a nonprofit, and if there isn&amp;rsquo;t a clear understanding already in place about how to effectively mobilize people toward actions that will make a positive difference, then I would be worried about getting distracted by chasing benefit concerts and bake sales all over the world. Enthusiastic supporters are great, but sometimes you have to channel them in the right direction.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Finally, even if online organizing dovetails well with community organizing, the mobilizing of third-party advocates only effects change if that mobilization is directed in a useful direction.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> You might get a lot of people to sign a petition, but does that actually aid the community you supposedly help? You might attract a lot of donations, but does that actually support the people you say you represent? &lt;strong>These are classic nonprofit challenges that don&amp;rsquo;t go away simply through electronic networking.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p> &lt;p>Online organizing doesn&amp;rsquo;t replace real on-the-ground community organizing or empowerment. (This is actually one of my concerns with the &lt;a href="https://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2006/07/an_interview_wi.html">Second Life nonprofit fad&lt;/a>, but that&amp;rsquo;s for another post.) Action online only matters if it can be translated into the real world, or if it can develop social bonds that provide the framework for real-world action.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="social-networking-to-stop-genocide" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Social Networking to Stop Genocide&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Some of GI-Net&amp;rsquo;s social networking campaigns online:&lt;/p> &lt;ul> &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070302163843/http://myspace.com/genocideintervention">MySpace&lt;/a>&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a data-dead-link="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2204803189" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/dead-link/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgroup.php%3Fgid%3D2204803189" title="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2204803189 [dead link]" >Facebook&lt;/a >&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a data-dead-link="http://del.icio.us/antigenocide" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/dead-link/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdel.icio.us%2Fantigenocide" title="http://del.icio.us/antigenocide [dead link]" >del.icio.us&lt;/a > and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070619111521/http://ma.gnolia.com/people/antigenocide">Magnolia&lt;/a>&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://endgenocide.livejournal.com/profile">LiveJournal&lt;/a>&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://flickr.com/photos/genocideintervention">Flickr&lt;/a>&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/genocideintervention">YouTube&lt;/a>&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> &lt;hr> &lt;ol> &lt;li id="fn:1"> &lt;p>Interestingly, there have been very few effective online campaigns (using SNS or otherwise) with organizations that directly represent the communities they organize (e.g. homeless rights movements as opposed to advocates from the Global North raising money for Africa). The big one that comes to mind is the immigrants rights marches in the United States. Yet in that case, most of the mobilization came from &lt;a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/voices-new-movimiento/">radio DJs and existing labor ties&lt;/a>, not the Internet. And when social networking did come into play, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/28/AR2006032800982.html">student walkouts&lt;/a> in Virginia and Maryland, they were largely decentralized, with no organization pointing the way or setting up MySpace profiles to encourage the movement.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p> &lt;/li> &lt;/ol> &lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Different kinds of elites (and different kinds of elitism)</title><link>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2006/05/different-kinds-elites-different-kinds-elitism/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2006/05/different-kinds-elites-different-kinds-elitism/</guid><description>&lt;p>In his &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061009224506/http://www.netsquared.org/conference/conference-sessions/making-the-most-of-disruption">NetSquared presentation&lt;/a> with &lt;a href="https://rheingold.com/">Howard Rheingold&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061009230616/http://www.netsquared.org/conference/confirmed-presenters/paul-saffo-director-and-roy-amara-fellow-institute-for-the-future">Paul Saffo&lt;/a> said that social movements, online and otherwise, &amp;ldquo;need elites&amp;rdquo; in order to effect change.&lt;/p> &lt;p>At first, this struck me as a popular myth &amp;ndash; that social movements never accomplish things through activism alone &amp;ndash; when in fact that&amp;rsquo;s been pretty &lt;a href="https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/force-powerful-english/">spectacularly disproven&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>But then Paul continued, and said that what he meant was &amp;ldquo;thought leaders&amp;rdquo; like Dr. King &amp;ndash; an instructive example, since his oratories and marches were supported by a network of churches and supporters and &lt;a href="https://highlandercenter.org/">specific strategic planning&lt;/a> that made his leadership possible.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Earlier, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061009234211/http://www.netsquared.org/conference/conference-sessions/conversation-with-angela-glover-blackwell">Angela Glover-Blackwell&lt;/a> noted that traditionally, social change organizations had acted as the representatives for the vulnerable. Now, those voices are breaking through without the need for these nonprofits &amp;ndash; a potentially threatening prospect.&lt;/p> &lt;p>That made me think about the different kinds of &amp;ldquo;elites&amp;rdquo; that social movements and social networks engender. In my mind, there are four:&lt;/p> &lt;ul> &lt;li>&lt;strong>Power elites&lt;/strong> are the traditional decisionmakers, who might also be termed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence">Weberian elites&lt;/a> because of their support by the state. They have a strong hold on direct power, though has been shown through nonviolent conflict and the &amp;ldquo;paradox of repression&amp;rdquo; (think of the dictators overthrown by popular movements) they nonetheless depend on a limited sort of consent from those over whom they rule.&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;strong>Resource elites&lt;/strong> are those who have the infrastructure (or the capacity to develop it) to make things possible &amp;ndash; be that change or stasis. Traditionally this has been people with the most money or natural resources; a relevant aspect of this today would be people (or communities) with the most access to technology.&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;strong>Idea elites&lt;/strong> are the ideological leaders who emerge, either hierarchically or communally, from a given social movement. These are the people who develop policy and drive debates &amp;ndash; but much of their power comes from the movement itself; while they can lead to a limited extent, they are always in danger of losing their power to the next big thinker.&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;strong>Literacy elites&lt;/strong> are those who can &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; the situation. They might be the ones most familiar with the technology (be that movable type or Movable Type) or the ones most adept at community organizing. Today, they might be the teenager who can navigate among the SNSes (and, as Howard Rheingold pointed out, may even be unaware of their political power).&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;p>It seems important to me to keep these different types of elites in mind as we think about the intersections of technology and social change. One way of achieving change is by appealing to the state&amp;rsquo;s powerholders &amp;ndash; traditional power, that is. But throughout history, coalitions of people without this power have banded together to effect change. It may be that among the three other types of elites, a social movement can emerge that represents true democratic change.&lt;/p> &lt;p>One final thought: &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071009155523/http://www.netsquared.org/2006/conference/confirmed-presenters/daniel-ben-horin-founder-and-president-compumentor">Daniel Ben-Horin&lt;/a> made an off-hand comment about how many people had been trained in a kind of vanguard activism &amp;ndash; acting in the &amp;ldquo;best interests&amp;rdquo; of people. I think focusing on these different kinds of elites allows for something closer to &lt;a href="https://infed.org/mobi/paulo-freire-dialogue-praxis-and-education/">Paolo Freire&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;cointentional education&amp;rdquo; in which everyone is a student and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061230064445/http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~oliver/soc220/Lectures220/General/AntiRacism%20Quotes.htm">liberation is bound up together&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> Ethan Zuckerman makes a related point in his &lt;a href="https://ethanzuckerman.com/2006/05/30/my-talk/" title="Read the entire presentation at the NetSquared conference.">presentation&lt;/a> when he says the new mantra for advocacy organizations should be: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t speak.

I had written out my introduction earlier this week, but due to a browser mishap lost nearly all of it and haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to re-write it until now.&lt;/p> &lt;p>GI-Net is a nonprofit based in DC that is a little more than two years old. We began as a student group at Swarthmore College with an idea: to change the way the world responds to genocide. In her groundbreaking and Pulitzer Prize–winning book, &lt;em>&amp;lsquo;A Problem From Hell&amp;rsquo;: America and the Age of Genocide&lt;/em>, &lt;a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/why-cant-we/" title="Read a recent commencement speech by Samantha Power">Samantha Power&lt;/a> surveys the U.S. response to genocides in the twentieth century and discovers that, above all, the reason the United States so often failed to act, or to act too late or ineffectively, was simply because there was no political will. In essence, it was easier for presidents and members of Congress to do nothing while genocide was being perpetrated and apologize for it later, than risk political capital taking action.&lt;/p> &lt;p>As a result of our origins as a student group, we have a strong history in using online social networking and viral campaigns, and this continues even as we branch out into other constituencies. In our first year of existence, we raised a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060709042957/http://www.genocideintervention.net/donate/info.php" title="Learn more about GI-Net's fundraising for peacekeepers">quarter-million dollars&lt;/a> for peacekeepers in Darfur &amp;ndash; the only NGO to raise money for protection rather than humanitarian aid &amp;ndash; primarily through student networks, both actual and virtual. In my work for GI-Net, I am heavily influenced by &lt;a href="https://rheingold.com/" title="Howard Rheingold's website">Howard Rheingold&lt;/a>, Christian Crumlish&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060707224126/http://thepowerofmany.com/" title="'The Power of Many' book and website">&lt;em>The Power of Many&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060710192840/http://www.network-centricadvocacy.net/" title="Marty Kearns' blog">Marty Kearns&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://netcentriccampaigns.org/" title="Netcentric Campaigns">Network-Centric Advocacy&lt;/a> and similar movements.&lt;/p> &lt;p>How can online activism build a movement that prevents and stops genocide? Read on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p> &lt;p>This might get a bit long, so:&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="first-a-little-background" class="link_owner">&lt;span>First, a little background&amp;hellip;&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I am a self-taught &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207093051/http://quixotic1.com/" title="My website, quixotic1.com">web developer&lt;/a> and artist (digitally and otherwise) with a strong interest in peacebuilding, community organizing and empowerment. My major at Swarthmore was not computer-related but rather peace and conflict studies, for which I wrote a thesis on &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080828193419/http://quixoticlife.net/tpni" title="Read more about the thesis">third-party nonviolent intervention organizations&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>While at Swarthmore I was involved with a number of campaigns, most notably &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040113040820/http://why-war.com/" title="Visit Why War?">Why War?&lt;/a>. Why War? was a prominent site for news and analysis against the war (first Afghanistan, and then Iraq). Its database from 2001–2004 is the most comprehensive accounting of articles and opinions on the war, resistance to it and the movements that arose on each side. We are most well-known, however, for a campaign that had little to do with the war.&lt;/p> &lt;p>In 2003, internal emails from the electronic voting machine manufacturer Diebold emerged that suggested the company had misled voting officials in numerous states about the security of its machines, had violated contracts with states by installing new software that had not been certified, and had knowingly implemented voting systems with severe security vulnerabilities. Investigative journalist &lt;a href="https://blackboxvoting.org/" title="Bev Harris and Black Box Voting">Bev Harris&lt;/a> and the UK &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040803082657/http://www.why-war.com/news/2003/10/14/allthepr.html" title="Article: All the President's Votes?">&lt;em>Independent&lt;/em>&lt;/a> had documented some of the serious problems, but few had taken notice, and Harris had been repeatedly threatened by her ISP, fearful of repercussions from Diebold&amp;rsquo;s lawyers.&lt;/p> &lt;p>A member of Why War? decided to &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040712083338/http://www.why-war.com/features/2003/10/diebold.html" title="View the Diebold files">post an archive&lt;/a> of the internal files on his website. After Swarthmore threatened to shut off our Internet access in the face of baseless copyright infringement claims from Diebold, we initiated a global campaign of electronic civil disobedience, in which students at universities would post mirrors of the files on their own servers, staying ahead of each specious take-down request. Simultaneously, our friends in what would become &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060707010513/http://www.freeculture.org/" title="FreeCulture.org">FreeCulture.org&lt;/a> sued Diebold through the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2003/11/03" title="Learn more about the Diebold case">Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a> for abusive copyright threats.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The combination of civil disobedience and civil action paid off handsomely. Within two months, Diebold backed down from their legal threats and resigned themselves to the damaging information about them now in the public domain. Suspicion of Diebold and other electronic voting machine manufacturers &amp;ndash; and, thus, consistent investigation into their practices &amp;ndash; remains high.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="back-to-genocide" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Back to genocide&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>So how does the Genocide Intervention Network use the Internet to effect social change? There are three primary ways.&lt;/p> &lt;p>First, we &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060118220930/http://www.genocideintervention.net/donate/" title="Learn more about donating to GI-Net">raise money online&lt;/a> directly for peacekeepers in Darfur. This is unprecedented &amp;ndash; never before has the average person been able to directly affect human security in the midst of a genocide. We raise money through a variety of techniques such as &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060706215139/http://www.genocideintervention.net/fundraise/virtual.php" title="Learn about virtual house parties">virtual house parties&lt;/a> (a favorite among Facebook and MySpace users), &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060706215126/http://www.genocideintervention.net/fundraise/dinners.php" title="Learn about dinners for Darfur">dinners for Darfur&lt;/a> and old-fashioned member volunteering. (A piano teacher in Utah giving two weeks&amp;rsquo; proceeds; a &amp;ldquo;battle of the bands&amp;rdquo; fundraiser in California; a bat mitzvah in New Jersey; a frat party in Massachusetts.)&lt;/p> &lt;p>Our second component is education. People can&amp;rsquo;t act against genocide unless they know about it, which is why we partnered with the American Progress Action Fund in 2005 to launch the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060703175035/http://beawitness.org/splash/" title="Visit BeAWitness.org">Be A Witness campaign&lt;/a>, urging the news media to adequately cover the crisis in Darfur. Our analysis showed that in June 2005, the major networks ran 50 times as many stories about Michael Jackson and 12 times as many stories about Tom Cruise as about the genocide in Darfur. In fact, in all of 2005 CBS ran just two minutes &amp;ndash; total &amp;ndash; on the issue, a fact that motivated more than 30,000 viewers to take action through the viral video and website. Because of the paltry news coverage, we also issue &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060706214512/http://www.genocideintervention.net/educate/darfurnews/" title="Read the latest report from Darfur">weekly news reports&lt;/a> from the ground in Darfur.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Finally, we give our members the tools to advocate for protection in the face of genocide. We use &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060710155602/http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/organizationsORG/ginetwork/campaign.jsp?campaign_KEY=3407" title="Read our most recent advocacy campaign">Democracy in Action&lt;/a> to direct our national campaigns, and work closely with the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060707032526/http://www.genocideintervention.net/advocate/divestment/" title="Learn more about divestment from Sudan">Sudan divestment task force&lt;/a> at the state level. In April, we brought more than 850 students to Washington, D.C. as part of the &lt;a data-dead-link="http://www.powertoprotect.org/" href="https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/rootwork.org/dead-link/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.powertoprotect.org%2F" title="Learn more about &amp;#39;P2P&amp;#39; [dead link]" >Power to Protect: D.C. to Darfur&lt;/a > weekend. The P2P website, which uses the &lt;a href="https://drupal.org/" title="Drupal.org">Drupal&lt;/a> open-source community platform, is key to sustaining these activists through the summer, when they will act as the catalysts for local anti-genocide groups in their hometowns.&lt;/p> &lt;h3 id="coming-up-next" class="link_owner">&lt;span>Coming up next&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We are in the planning stages of a number of exciting online campaigns to further support the emerging anti-genocide movement. Our main website will be moved to Drupal to allow our members to connect with local leaders and organizations, and concretely affect the direction of the national campaigns.&lt;/p> &lt;p>A photo petition, using &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060707182012/http://forwardtrack.eyebeamresearch.org/" title="Learn about ForwardTrack">ForwardTrack&lt;/a> and our &lt;a href="https://flickr.com/photos/genocideintervention" title="See our most recent photos on Flickr">Flickr&lt;/a> account, will put a human face on the victims in Darfur. Viewers will be asked to upload images of themselves holding a sign with &amp;ndash; not a comment or a pledge &amp;ndash; but the name of one of the hundreds of thousands of victims in Darfur. These photos will be delivered to members of Congress to show the depth of human involvement &amp;ndash; and human crisis &amp;ndash; around Darfur.&lt;/p> &lt;p>More than one of our members has asked us to be their designated charity for a marathon, and so our next fundraising tool will be a website to enable them to do just that. Members will be able to distribute information about the race and GI-Net, collect pledges online, and then follow-up with donors after the race.&lt;/p> &lt;p>I would be happy to talk further with any of you about GI-Net or &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060706215202/http://www.genocideintervention.net/advocate/tenthings.php" title="Ten things you can do right now to stop genocide!">our ideas&lt;/a>, but this post is already mighty long, so I&amp;rsquo;ll stop here. Thanks again for allowing me to come, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing everyone!&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;em>Update, Sept. 12, 2007: This blog post has been adapted into a chapter of the book&lt;/em> &lt;a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/online-social-networking/oclc/731757535&amp;amp;referer=brief_results">Online social networking&lt;/a> &lt;em>(2008), edited by Sylvia Engdahl, under the title &amp;ldquo;Online social networking is being used to oppose genocide.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

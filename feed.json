How has it changed your own\nworkflow?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMW: Before Sass 3.2 came out I had written an article for The Sass Way that\npreviewed some of it\u0026rsquo;s new features, including the ability to use variables in\nmedia queries. I created an example that baked in some names for breakpoints\ninto a kind of \u0026ldquo;master mixin\u0026rdquo; for media queries. On my next responsive project I\nput the theories I\u0026rsquo;d written for that post into practice, and found that I could\nrefine that approach. If I assigned a variable to each media query first the\napproach would be very flexible. Then when noticed that I wrote min-width\nqueries way more often than any other type I set up defaults that made creating\nmedia queries very fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMW: There was a side effect that I think is more useful though. By assigning\nnames to each of my media queries I\u0026rsquo;m able to keep them in context in a much\nmore effective way. If I some media queries to deal with the width of a nav\nelement, and then later I add an item to that nav, I can change the value of\nthat variable and all the associated queries are adjusted. This is even more\neffective when handing code back and forth within a team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSR: Breakpoint was created with the motivation to ease many of the pain points\nof working with media queries in CSS. The biggest pain point that Breakpoint\nsolves is providing meaningful semantics to your media queries. When building\ncontent based responsive sites, early in your design process two unrelated items\nmay happen to break at the same points, but as your project grows, those points\nmay change and a simple find and replace will have unintended consequences. This\nis probably the biggest workflow win to using Breakpoint, all of your media\nqueries now have proper semantics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSR: The other big win for my workflow is Breakpoint\u0026rsquo;s\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/at-import/breakpoint/wiki/No-Query-Fallbacks\"\u003eno-query fallback\u003c/a\u003e,\nallowing me to very easily add in fallback code for any of the media queries I\nwrite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIB: What can Breakpoint do that just assigning variable names to specific\nmin-widths can\u0026rsquo;t?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSR: For starters, Breakpoint handles much more than min-width queries. It is\ndesigned to be future friendly and currently supports all CSS level 3 and level\n4 media queries. Additionally, it\u0026rsquo;s syntax is easy to use to create complex\nmedia queries, including both and and or media queries. It has native handling\nfor all of the different media query requirement for resolution (of which you\nneed to write at least four different queries for currently) while just writing\nthe standard. The no-query fallbacks are a huge win as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMW: The main benefit is that you can assign names and manage your media queries\nwith variables. This helps you avoid having them scattered around your SCSS, and\nmakes is easy to understand how they\u0026rsquo;re related and affect each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMW: While Breakpoint is optimized for min-width because they\u0026rsquo;re used most often\nit doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop there. There are a number of shortcuts built in, for fencing\nmin- and max- values, converting pixels to ems, and even vendor prefixed queries\nlike resolution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMW: We even created a way to Breakpoint to report back to you what queries are\nin a particular context.\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/at-import/Singularity\"\u003eSingularity GS\u003c/a\u003e uses this feature to\nkind of magically create responsive grid systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSR: Of all of Breakpoint\u0026rsquo;s features, probably the least used, but most powerful\nis\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/at-import/breakpoint/wiki/Breakpoint-Context\"\u003eBreakpoint Context\u003c/a\u003e.\nThis allows you to call a function anywhere and get the current media query\ncontext allowing for amazingly intelligent mixins and functions to be written in\nSass, something unique to Breakpoint that you simply don\u0026rsquo;t have with\ninterpolating variables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIB: Are there any responsive web design aspects specific to Drupal\ntheming/frontend development that Breakpoint helps with?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSR: There is nothing Drupal specific that Breakpoint helps with. Breakpoint,\nlike Sass, was built to be backend independent. This means that if you are\nbuilding any site, regardless of if it\u0026rsquo;s a Drupal site or a Node site or a\nstatic site, Breakpoint is able to do its job handily without being caught up in\nbeing tied to a specific backend technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMW: One of the things I love about working with Sass is that it\u0026rsquo;s not\nDrupal-specific, and it\u0026rsquo;s meant to be used anywhere on the web. Breakpoint\nfollows that example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIB: Is Breakpoint a successor to\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/snugug/respond-to\"\u003eRespond-To\u003c/a\u003e, or will that continue to get\ndeveloped?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSR: In a way, yes and no. Respond-To was written before Breakpoint, but upon\nBreakpoint\u0026rsquo;s release, it was decided that our efforts should be focused on a\nunified Media Query engine, with Respond-To as a wrapper syntax for Breakpoint.\nThis is how the current Respond-To project exists. As of Breakpoint 2.0, the\nRespond-To mixin has been incorporated into Breakpoint core, so you now can use\nRespond-To without needing an additional Compass extension!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIB: Do you use\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/breakpoints\"\u003eBreakpoints module\u003c/a\u003e (in Drupal 8\ncore)? Or do you just do all of that through Sass?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSR: I personally truly dislike the Breakpoint module. Every use case I\u0026rsquo;ve heard\nfor it seems to be based on the thinking that sites have three or four\nbreakpoints and that everything can be boiled down into an easy to use admin\ninterface. There are no standard breakpoints, period, and good, reasonably\ncomplex responsive sites will usually have 20 or more breakpoints. Responsive\ncannot be done from the backend, and the Breakpoint module encourages you to do\nso (as does the\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/spark\"\u003eSpark layout initiative\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIB: Do you think any aspects of Breakpoint might get rolled directly into Sass\nin the future?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMW: It\u0026rsquo;s possible, but we probably won\u0026rsquo;t move the obvious parts to the Sass\nlanguage. There are some helper functions that we\u0026rsquo;ve written in Ruby that would\nbe very useful in Sass core. Once that\u0026rsquo;s in we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to offer Breakpoint\nwithout Compass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSR: I do not believe Breakpoint will be rolled directly into Sass, nor would I\nwant it to be, as it is out of scope of Sass core. As much as I like them, I\neven think the color functions in Sass are out of scope for it. Sass core should\nsimply be the language and the bare minimum function base for it to be useable.\nSass doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with any mixins, and I think it should probably stay that way.\nThat being said, Breakpoint is fairly stable; our 1.3 release stood stable for\nsix or so months without needing any changes until we rewrote the whole thing\nfor our 2.x release, so maybe being merged into Compass isn\u0026rsquo;t out of the\nquestion, but I do not see a need for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIB: I hear in addition to Breakpoint, Sam went and created some kind of magic\nbox of Sass called \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/at-import/toolkit\"\u003eToolkit\u003c/a\u003e. Want to say\nmore about that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSR: Toolkit started life as RWD Kickstart, a project Mason and I kind of made up\non the spot a year ago at one of the first New York Sass meetups. Its original\ngoal was simply to be a collection of Compass templates to make pulling in media\nquery and grid solutions together easily. Since then, it\u0026rsquo;s evolved to be more of\na collection of Progressive Enhancement, Design in Browser, and Modern Web\nDevelopment tools, a toolkit if you\u0026rsquo;ll let me, of useful tools. I\u0026rsquo;d say the four\nbiggest thing that Toolkit has are a modern Clearfix mixin, progressive\nenhancement replace text mixins, a triangle generation mixin, and an intrinsic\nratio mixin to make using intrinsic ratios super easy. It also adds\n\u003ccode\u003e*, *:before, *:after { box-sizing: border-box}\u003c/code\u003e and\n\u003ccode\u003eimg, video { max-width: 100%; height: auto; }\u003c/code\u003e to your stylesheets, which are\nthe first two things I do for any responsive project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSR: Toolkit\u0026rsquo;s templates have also evolved, Where originally there were five some\nodd different templates to choose from, now there are just two, a basic one to\nset up a basic partial structure, and a responsive web design one that pulls in\nBreakpoint 2.x for media queries and Singularity 1.x for grids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIB: You \u003ca href=\"http://breakpoint-sass.com/\"\u003esure know\u003c/a\u003e those late twentieth-century\npresidents.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMW: With a name like Breakpoint, how could I not revisit the cinema classic\nPoint Break.

Male is a kind of genderless base state. So is it\nwith accessibility. When we speak of making something accessible, we tend to\nrefer to making an interface for blind users or for users with physical\ncapabilities that make keyboard and mouse use difficult, as examples. Visual is\na kind of accessible base state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe risk \u0026ldquo;othering\u0026rdquo; folks for whom accessibility is an issue because as\ndevelopers, in general, non-visual accessibility has not been a primary concern.\nI know what is is like to be othered. In some ways, highlighting otherness can\nbe an effective way to bring focus to a problem. Eventually though, we need to\nresolve those issues and close the loop on the otherness. We can be other and\nalso be equal. Now is the time for front end developers to start thinking about\naccessibility as a multi-modal effort.

As noted above,\nworking-class communities, communities of color, folks with less formal\neducation and various kinds of \u0026ldquo;marginalized\u0026rdquo; groups interact with online social\nnetworks very differently, often because of stronger real-world social networks.\nThe best organizing strategy activates people through all their social\nconnections, whether online or offline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"final-thoughts\" class=\"link_owner\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEngaging supporters on social networks is long-term.\u003c/strong\u003e Don\u0026rsquo;t expect\nimmediate results.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt takes effort.\u003c/strong\u003e You need to be willing to communicate, in both\ndirections, with your supporters.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you want your members to spread your message, you have to trust them.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeedback in the comments below is welcome!

It is somewhat harder to design\nto not look like \u0026ldquo;a Joomla site\u0026rdquo; but there\u0026rsquo;s no question that it\u0026rsquo;s faster to\nset up and publish a simple website.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFree software is great and all, but if you have no budget and no design or\nprogramming resources in-house, you may want to stick with that commercial CMS\nyou know \u0026ndash; or even Dreamweaver or FrontPage sites. The cost of free software\nis the development time, and that isn\u0026rsquo;t an insignificant concern. If you\u0026rsquo;re\nplanning a big campaign and have a budget or in-house developers, I highly\nrecommend one of the open-source CMSes because of all of the strengths\nmentioned above (and particularly that they won\u0026rsquo;t lock you into some horrible\nproprietary code nightmare). But not every nonprofit will have that luxury,\nand you should carefully consider if you have the money or staff time to build\na site from scratch.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAbove, I mentioned that many Drupal modules offer integration with other\nsoftware and web services. This is true, but not for every piece of software\nout there, and not always as robustly as you might like. In particular, if you\nhave a lot of tight integration needs and already have another piece hosted\nwith another service \u0026ndash; a donor database or an online action suite, for\ninstance \u0026ndash; it may make sense to build your website using their own CMS to\nallow for the tightest possible integration. You\u0026rsquo;ll give up some of the cool\nDrupal functionality and customization possibilities, but when it comes time\nto run those end-year reports, you just push a button.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDrupal is built by volunteers. Some of them are paid web developers who\nvoluntarily contribute their work back to the Drupal community. But nothing is\nguaranteed \u0026ndash; that module you depend on might have a bug that doesn\u0026rsquo;t get\nfixed for six months. There are ways to help guard against this \u0026ndash; for\ninstance, by sticking to modules\n\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080805011707/http://www.lullabot.com/audiocast/drupal_podcast_no_40_top_40_projects\"\u003erecommended\u003c/a\u003e\nby\n\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080803004646/http://webpodge.com/2007/02/22/top-10-drupal-modules/\"\u003eothers\u003c/a\u003e,\nand checking to see how often past releases have come out, but it\u0026rsquo;s definitely\nsomething to consider.
